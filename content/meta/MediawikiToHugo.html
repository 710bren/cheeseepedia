Hello user! Cheese-E-Pedia has moved from Miraheze to being a statically generated Hugo site. This provides many benefits for customization, article formatting, and easy archival of the site for offline use. I wanna go over changes and expectations for what this entails.

<h3>Changes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>With this move however, if you're an active contributor this GitHub page will be your new home for submitting edits! You can navigate to each page in /wiki/ and edit its .html file just like editing on the wiki! More resourceful users can fork the repository on your GitHub account, make changes to whatever you need either on-site or downloaded on your desktop, and then submit a "Pull Request" here to have your changes merged into the live site. This process opens you up to not just working on a single article at a time, but you can edit multiple files as a single commit, and can change any section of the site- including its layout and design! Commits will not be automatically live however so we can review your changes. It may be beneficial to now make larger contributions instead of many tiny edits. Pull Requests also have comment sections now, so we may stop a merge from happening by letting you know if there's something you need to fix first.</li>
    <li>Accounts also technically don't exist anymore! Pages now have a "contributors" section where you'll need to sign off with your username. The site keeps track of every contributor name and will display your contributed pages on your user page, and yes you still do have a user page!</li>
    <li>The site is now going to lock down more of its templating and styling to ensure page formatting is consistent. For example, standard rules wanted pages to have a ``Template:Generic`` with a picture as the article picture to properly embed it in previews and SEO. A lot of pages however just inserted a normal image in that spot. Now each page will have a multitude of prompts to fill out such as images, a gallery, dates, titles, ect- to keep consistency (and to allow us to change the site design easily without changing articles themselves).</li>
    <li>Archiving the site, keeping offline copies, and forking it to rehost is now super easy! The entire site is all on this one page, and most web servers (like DigitalOcean) will auto-update the site straight from your GitHub fork for almost 0 cost.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How do I edit?</h3>
Same as usual! Go to an article and hit the Edit Page button. This will take you to GitHub to edit the exact file. You'll have to make a GitHub account first. After that you'll submit the changes and we'll either comment on any changes or pull it through to the site! Changes won't be instant like they used to so we can review them.
