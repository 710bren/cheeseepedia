This tutorial is for downloading and compiling Cheese-E-Pedia to be used locally on your computer. This is useful for doing live editing of the site, or for compiling it for your own self-host or offline copy.
<ul>
    <li>The repository is not the Cheese-E-Pedia website itself, rather a collection of files that will be compiled into a static site. First download the repository from the {{< github-repository >}}.</li>
    <li>It is reccomended to fork the site and have <a href="https://desktop.github.com/download/">GitHub Desktop</a> download the project to your computer, that way any changes can be pushed as Pull Requests to this repository for inclusion.</li>
    <li>Download <a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/tag/v0.92.2">Hugo v0.92.2+extended</a> which is the compiler for the site.</li>
    <li>Download Visual Studio Code from your store of choice. Go to ``File>Open Folder`` and open the ``Cheeseepedia`` folder.</li>
    <li>Click on the bottom of Visual Studio Code where the ``⨂ 0 ⚠ 0`` text is. This will open a new section.</li>
    <li>On the tabs at the top of the section, click the ``Terminal`` window.</li>
    <li>To preview the site, type ``hugo server`` and let it compile. It will provide a link to a local port to open in your browser. Any changes you make to the files in Visual Studio Code will now auto-update the site (not always though).</li>
    <li>To close out of the preview, hit ``Ctrl + C`` in the terminal.</li>
    <li>To compile the site for rehosting somewhere else, or to have a permanent compilation to use in the browser, just type ``hugo``. The site will be compiled to the ``/public/`` folder.</li>
</ul>
