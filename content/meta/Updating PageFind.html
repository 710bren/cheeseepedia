This tutorial is for updating the PageFind library that runs the site's searchbar for use in your forked or offline instance. It isn't needed to ever use if you're just a contributor to the main site as it is run often enough by the admins, but it is useful if you're spinning off your own instance. 
<br><br>
This is only doable after completing <a href="{{< ref "/meta/Compiling Cheese-E-Pedia through Hugo" >}}">"Compiling Cheese-E-Pedia through Hugo"</a> first. PageFind doesn't automatically update itself when the wiki is changed, so every once and a while this should be run to update summaries, titles, and add in new pages.

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Once your newest changes have been finished, run <code>hugo</code> to generate the entire site to the "cheeseepedia/public" folder.</li>
    <li>When that is complete, run <code>./pagefind --site "public" --output-subdir ../static/pagefind --glob "wiki/**/*.{html}"</code>. This should update PageFind in the codebase.</li>
    <li>Run <code>hugo server</code> or <code>hugo</code> again to see your results. If you don't ever use fully generated sites and just the live ones from <code>hugo server</code>, you can delete the "cheeseepedia/public" folder now.</li>
</ul>
