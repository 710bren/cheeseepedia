Thanks for wanting to contribute to Cheese-E-Pedia! Thankfully this process is easy for any article. For this first example let's just assume you're wanting to do some quick grammar edits to a page and submit your results, here's how:
<br>
<ul>
    <li>First, find the article you want to edit and hit the "Edit Page" button on the top right. You can use this article as an example.</li>
    <li>Articles are .html files with some TOML formatting at the beginning. If you've ever made a webpage its the same way of writing.</li>
    <li>Some quick formatting notes: <code>&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</code> for <b>bold</b>, <code>&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code> for <i>italics</i>, <code>&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;</code> for article headings. Places like  <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">w3schools</a> provide all the info you'll need for lists, tables, ect. You can also browse other article's files to see how they do things.</li>
    <li>For editing the article on Github its generally straightforward. Change the text, hit "Commit Changes", write down what you did, and submit. If you want this process broken down, Github itself has a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/editing-files#editing-files-in-another-users-repository">great tutorial here.</a> Go ahead and edit the article now.</li>
</ul>
Before you submit!
<ul>
    <li>First thing you wanna do is update the <code>date = 0000-00-00</code> at the top of the file to today's date. It goes YEAR-MONTH-DAY, so like <code>2024-12-31</code>. This appears at the bottom of each page as "Last updated on:..." so users know how recent the changes have been.</li>
    <li>Next, add your name to the contributors list! At the top of the file there should be a category bracket saying <code></code>, and below it <code>contributors = ["User 1","User 2"]</code>. Add your username in quotes with a comma, so it'd now look like <code>contributors = ["User 1","User 2","User 3"]</code>. This puts you on the contributors list at the bottom of the page, and also tracks your contribution count in the users list accesible from Contributor Home or the homepage! Be sure to keep your name consistent across article edits! Also don't use quotes or backslashes in your name or it'll break things.</li>
</ul>
I submitted! Now what?
<ul>
    <li>Your edit is now in the review process by the mod team. When we have the time we'll go over your edits and ensure they meet wiki standards and won't break anything. We may leave a comment on the edit asking for more info or letting you know to change something before it's merged, so check on your contributions or set up email notifications!</li>
    <li>Once your edit is approved, it'll be added to the site. The site automatically updates when any changes are merged, but this can take between 5 and 10 minutes to appear on the live site.</li>
</ul>
And that's it! For more complex article editing such as tags, categories, parameters, image insertions, creating new pages, ect, check the rest of the tutorials!
