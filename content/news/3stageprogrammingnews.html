On March 21, 2025, all Cyberamic {{< wiki-link "CEC Legacy Locations" >}}, which include {{< wiki-link "Northridge, CA (8425 Reseda Blvd)" >}}, {{< wiki-link "Hicksville, NY (Delco Plaza 11-15 Hanover Place)" >}}, and {{< wiki-link "Mississauga, Ontario, Canada (4141 Dixie Rd)" >}} will now be using 3-Stage signals.
<br><br>
This began with {{< wiki-link "Northridge, CA (8425 Reseda Blvd)" >}}, which actually began testing the signals in December of 2024. Each of the stores have now recieved a new EPROM chip to convert 3-Stage signals to Cyberamic signals, which are not in the exact same configuration as the {{< wiki-link "CEC-Stage Rosetta" >}} had them. Currently noted are that eyelids, head ups, and Munch/Pasqually arms have inverted movements- meaning eyes are closed when they're supposed to be open. This is due to how movements are designed differently between stages, though more perplexingly some other inverted movements were corrected- and Northridge's tests did not include this bug. The {{< wiki-link "Navori System" >}} now just has a single playlist for both types of stores, which also forces the Cyberamic stages to use the 3-Stage diagnostics, which can be unhelpful with the miriad of unused or reformatted movements.
