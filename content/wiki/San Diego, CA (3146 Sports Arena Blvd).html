<p><b><i>3146 Sports Arena Blvd, Store #441</b></i> is a <i>Chuck E. Cheese's</i> located in Rosecrans Plaza that opened on April 19, 1993, with a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/1-Stage" >}}">1-Stage</a>.</p>
<p>This location should not be confused with <a href="{{< ref "wiki/San Diego, CA (6403 El Cajon Blvd)" >}}">the El Cajon Blvd location</a>, <a href="{{< ref "wiki/San Diego  Mira Mesa, CA (9840 Hibert St)" >}}">San Diego Hilbert St / Mira Mesa location</a>, or <a href="{{< ref "wiki/San Diego, CA (3414 College Ave)" >}}">the College Avenue location</a>, all which opened in March 1981 and closed in 1984, opened in 1981/1982, and is still open, and opened on December 19th, 2012, which is also still open.</p>
<p>Rosecrans Plaza was formerly Glasshouse Square, which is considered to be one of San Diego's haunted areas by few.</p>
<p><h2> Stages</h2></p>
<p>This location opened with one of the first 1-Stages, being one of the first to resemble what it would look finalized. This stage had prototype elements such as the black valence and 'Live Amateur Hour' prop.</p>
<p>In early to mid-2004, this location received a Studio C 2000 stage with a 16 movement CEC Animatronic. The animatronic rapidly declined in condition beginning in the early 2010's and would end up becoming nearly static on some occasions.</p>
<p>On June 13th, 2023, Studio C was removed and replaced with the dance floor and video wall, which are still there to this day.</p>
<p><h2>History</h2></p>
<p>Before becoming a CEC, it was originally a locally owned arcade called 'Yellow Brick Road.' The arcade eventually closed in 1992 and CEC swiftly took over the space. Despite opening in 1993 this location opened with a 1992 version of the interior stylings from the 1994 SPT Repositioning / Remodel Program.<sup>[1]</sup></p>
<p><h3> Remodels </h3></p>
<p>This location only received only one of their two remodels in 2006, which moved their Studio C from the left side wall back corner to the right side wall.  In July 2010, they expanded behind the right side wall and relocated the showroom and Studio C to the new area.<sup>[2]</sup> The store began the 2.0 remodel in May 2023 and completed in July 2023. After completion, 14 games new games were installed, with most of the token games being removed.</p>
<p><h3>2021 S.W.A.T. Incident </h3></p>
<p>On January 14, 2021 around 4:15 PM, the San Diego PD and SWAT teams barricaded a suspect in front of the location to take a male into custody for a failed armed robbery at the next door Subway. The man had hostages but they escaped unharmed.<sup>[3]</sup></p>
