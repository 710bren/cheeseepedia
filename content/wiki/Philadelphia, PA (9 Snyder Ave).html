<p><b><i>9 Snyder Ave, Store #450</b></i> is a Chuck E. Cheese that opened on September 15, 1992 and is still open to this day.</p>
<p>It is located in the Snyder Plaza shopping center.</p>
<p>It should not be confused with the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Philadelphia, PA (9175 Roosevelt Blvd)" >}}">Philadelphia, PA (9175 Roosevelt Blvd)</a> location as that location opened 10 years, 1 month, and a week prior. This location and Roosevelt are 40 minutes away from each other.</p>
<p><h2> History </h2></p>
<p>Philadelphia on Snyder Ave opened on September 15th, 1992 with a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/2-Stage" >}}">2-Stage</a> (A decade, a month, and week after the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Philadelphia, PA (9175 Roosevelt Blvd)" >}}">Philadelphia, PA (9175 Roosevelt Blvd)</a> location opened) with the CEC 1988 Remodel|1988 Remodel. The store remained relatively unchanged until the Mid 1990's when they received <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Phase 1 (1994)" >}}">Phase 1</a> (Which involved the removal of elements from the 1988 remodel such as The Blue & White Awnings, checkers around the store, & neon lights). Then in the Early 2000's they remodeled to remove the Balcony Seating & Showroom Walls. It is unknown if this location ever received the Cool Chuck outfit. By 2010-2011, the Cool Chuck outfit was replaced with the Avenger outfit. Snyder would remodel again to receive the 2005 update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative in Mid 2011; involving the removal of the Dinner Lights, 90's Decorations, & added Purple Walls. Chuck's cap was removed in September 2013. Throughout the 2010's, the Snyder 2-Stage underwent numerous changes including the replacement of masks, & Chuck's outfit to Rockstar. The store would remain this way until June-July 2022 when Snyder received the 2.0 Remodel which involved the removal of the 2-Stage, moving the Dance Floor & Video Wall to face the back wall. As of February 2023, Snyder still has the 2.0 Remodel and the Dance Floor.</p>
