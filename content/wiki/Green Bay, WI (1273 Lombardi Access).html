<h2> History </h2>
Green Bay opened on October 28th, 1982 as the fourth Showbiz Pizza Place in Wisconsin, after Madison which opened 3 months prior which is July 7th & Milwaukee (Good Hope Rd & S 27th St, both opened a year prior in June 17th and August 27th, 1981, respectively) and as a corporate-owned store. Green Bay originally featured the Rock-afire Explosion, as all other Showbiz locations did. they would have it for a few years, until around 1991, when they would receive the 1988 remodel, receiving Concept Unification, where the Rock-afire Explosion characters were changed to the Chuck E. Cheese characters, and removing all SPP decor for newer decor. In the mid 1990s, Green Bay received a minor remodel removing older CU decor for the Record Posters and Colored Chase Lights. In the year of Fall 2000, they would receive the Phase 3 remodel replacing the 3-Stage with a Studio C Beta, 32m, removing older decor for newer decor, and adding SkyTubes. Green Bay would receive the 2005 remodel in 2008-2009 removing older decor for newer decor, and removed the Showroom Walls. The Toddler Zone was also removed during this remodel. Green Bay would remain like this until September 2021, when they would receive the 2.0 remodel, this involved removing the Studio C Beta, 32m stage and replacing it with a [[Chuck E. Live Stage (Dance Floor)|Dance Floor + Video Wall]]. The store's Grand Reopening was on November 10th, 2021<ref>https://www.wearegreenbay.com/news/local-news/ne-wisconsins-only-chuck-e-cheese-to-reopen-after-getting-remodeled/</ref>.

<h2> Stages </h2>
Originally, Green Bay featured a Rock-afire Explosion, as all other Showbiz locations did. In 1991, they would undergo Concept Unification, turning the Rock-afire Explosion into the 3-Stage. 

Green Bay would have the 3-Stage until the Fall of 2000, when they would receive one of the first Studio C Betas (along with [Birmingham, AL (500 Old Town Rd)]({{< ref "wiki/Birmingham, AL (500 Old Town Rd).html" >}})).

When the stage was first installed, The Bot had the late night outfit. Until the Early to Mid 2000's when they would replace it with the Cool Chuck Outfit. 

In the late 2000's-early 2010's, they would replace it  with the Avenger outfit, until around 2014, when they would put the Rockstar Jeans on Chuck E., Green Bay was the first to have The Rockstar Jeans and they would keep the Avenger shirt until they removed the stage. 

In September 2021, Green Bay would replace their Beta with a Dance Floor and Video Wall, as part of their 2.0 remodel. It was the only Studio C Beta in Wisconsin. 

As of March 2023, Green Bay still has the 2.0 Remodel and Dance Floor + Video Wall.

<h2> Trivia </h2>

* Green Bay was the 4th ShowBiz to open in Wisconsin after [Milwaukee, WI (7401 Good Hope Rd)]({{< ref "wiki/Milwaukee, WI (7401 Good Hope Rd).html" >}}) (Opened June 17, 1981), Milwaukee, WI (4595 S 27th St) (Opened August 27, 1981), & [Madison, WI (438 Grand Canyon Dr)]({{< ref "wiki/Madison, WI (438 Grand Canyon Dr).html" >}}) (Opened July 7, 1982).
* Green Bay was one of three ShowBiz locations in Wisconsin to undergo Concept Unification (The other two being Madison & [[La Crosse, WI (4444 State Rd)|La Crosse]]) as Milwaukee, WI (7401 Good Hope Rd) replaced their Rock-afire with a [[Cyberamics Rocker Stage|Rocker Stage]] in June 1988 (Their show would get Concept Unification when the show was installed at [[Raleigh, NC (3501-131 Capital Blvd)|Raleigh]]) and the store would eventually close sometime in 1995 with a [1-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/1-Stage.html" >}}). Milwaukee, WI (4595 S 27th St) & [[Appleton, WI (2424 W College Ave)|Appleton]] on the other hand were closed by 1986 and never converted into Chuck E. Cheese.
