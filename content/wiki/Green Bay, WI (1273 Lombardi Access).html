Green Bay originally featured the Rock-afire Explosion, as all other Showbiz locations did. they would have it for a few years, until around 1991, when they would receive the 1988 remodel, receiving Concept Unification, where the Rock-afire Explosion characters were changed to the Chuck E. Cheese characters, and removing all SPP decor for newer decor. In the mid 1990s, Green Bay received a minor remodel removing older CU decor for the Record Posters and Colored Chase Lights. In the year of Fall 2000, they would receive the Phase 3 remodel replacing the 3-Stage with a Studio C Beta, 32m, removing older decor for newer decor, and adding SkyTubes. Green Bay would receive the 2005 remodel in 2008-2009 removing older decor for newer decor, and removed the Showroom Walls. The Toddler Zone was also removed during this remodel. Green Bay would remain like this until September 2021, when they would receive the 2.0 remodel, this involved removing the Studio C Beta, 32m stage and replacing it with a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Chuck E Live Stage (Dance Floor)" >}}">Dance Floor + Video Wall</a>. The store's Grand Reopening was on November 10th, 2021<sup>(1)</sup>. As of March 2023, Green Bay still has the 2.0 remodel and Dance Floor + Video Wall.

Originally, Green Bay featured a Rock-afire Explosion, as all other Showbiz locations did. In 1991, they would undergo Concept Unification, turning the Rock-afire Explosion into the 3-Stage.
