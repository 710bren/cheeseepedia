The **Parrot Animatronic** is an animatronic figure created by Garner Holt Productions Inc. for Chuck E. Cheese's locations from 1997 to 2002

The bot is a green parrot, he stands on a little stick and can tilt his body up and turn the stick. He was only installed on the [Studio C Alpha]({{< ref "wiki/Studio C Alpha.md" >}}) stage and the rare Studio C Alpha/Beta Mix stage.

## History ##
The [Studio C]({{< ref "wiki/Studio C.md" >}}) concept originally debuted in December of 1997, this was a brand new show idea intended originally to replace all Munch's Make Believe Band stages (3-Stages, Road Stages, 2-Stages, and 1-Stages, including the C-Stages and Rocker Stages that still existed at the time) which featured one Chuck E. animatronic, and a little parrot named Bird. This setup was called the [Studio C Alpha]({{< ref "wiki/Studio C Alpha.md" >}}), and featured Chuck E. and Bird in a late night talk show studio, complete with a light up desk, a 'Pizza Time' clock, a pizza phone, an [Interactive Console]({{< ref "wiki/Interactive Console.md" >}}), and a Blue Screen with a camera. This stage was installed from 1997 to 2002 (except for Waldorf, MD, which relocated and brought the Alpha to the new store in 2012, and Dearborn, MI, which replaced their 3-Stage with the Alpha from Plano, TX which got the Chuck E. Live Stage (Dance Floor) (Chuck E. Live Stage) in May of 2015.) until being replaced with the Studio C Beta, which did not feature Bird. But there was another stage that included Bird, that was called the Studio C Alpha/Beta Mix, this stage came out in April of 2000 at the Athens, GA location (now '2.0') and included Bird on a taller stick than what was on the Studio C Alphas, there were 6 Alpha/Beta Mix's installed, and as of September 2022, there is only 1 Studio C Alpha/Beta Mix left in existence, that being the Midland, TX location, which was the 4th installed, the others (Athens, GA, Brownsville, TX, Tyler, TX, Clarksville, TN, and Jeddah, Saudi Arabia Corniche Rd) were removed due to 2.0, except for Jeddah, which closed in July 2019. Midland currently does not have Bird, just the Chuck E. animatronic.
