The <b>Bird Animatronic</b> is an animatronic figure created by Garner Holt Productions Inc. for Chuck E. Cheese's locations from 1997 to 2002

The bot is a mostly green parrot with wings that are red, orange, and yellow sitting on a perch. He was only installed on the [Studio C Alpha]({{< ref "wiki/Studio C Alpha.md" >}}) and Studio C Prototype stage.

<h2> History </h2>
The [Studio C]({{< ref "wiki/Studio C.md" >}}) concept originally debuted in December of 1997 as a brand-new show idea intended originally to replace all Munch's Make Believe Band stages which featured one Chuck E. animatronic, and a little parrot named Bird. This setup was called the [Studio C Alpha]({{< ref "wiki/Studio C Alpha.md" >}}), and featured Chuck E. and Bird in a late night talk show studio, complete with a light-up desk, a 'Pizza Time' clock, a pizza phone, an [Interactive Console]({{< ref "wiki/Interactive Console.md" >}}), and a Blue Screen with a camera. The bird was later included in the Studio C Prototype stage. This stage featured Bird on a taller perch than what was on the Studio C Alpha. This stage would be the last to feature Bird though, as future iterations of Studio C would not feature him.

<h2> Movements </h2>
The bot features 4 movements in total.
