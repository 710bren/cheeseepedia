{{Generic|image=Winchesterbird.jpg|desc=Picture of Winchester Helen with her nameplate in front.}}

**_Winchester Helen Henny**_ was a Guest animatronic featured at the [[San Jose, CA (370 S Winchester Blvd)]] Pizza Time Theatre. She would be replaced with [[Winchester Madame Oink (Animatronic)]] during February 1978.

## Fate## 
Her current whereabouts are unknown, but the most likely answer is she was destroyed in 1980 when Winchester installed their [[Cyberamics]]. Her design would later be reused for [[Kooser Helen Henny (Animatronic)]]

## Design## 
Helen has long brown hair, brown eyes, yellow hands with red painted fingernails, a black necklace with a gold medallion, and wears a white shirt with a purple vest over it.
