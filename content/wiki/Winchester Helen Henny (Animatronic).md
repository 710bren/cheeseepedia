the **_Winchester Helen Henny Animatronic**_ was an animatronic version of [Helen Henny]({{< ref "wiki/Helen Henny.md" >}}) created in August 1977 by [_Fantasy Forest_]({{< ref "wiki/Fantasy Forest.md" >}}) for the [_Pizza Time Theatre_]({{< ref "wiki/Pizza Time Theatre.md" >}}) on [San Jose, CA (370 S Winchester Blvd)]({{< ref "wiki/San Jose, CA (370 S Winchester Blvd).md" >}}). The Bot was removed in February 1978, when [Winchester Madam Oink]({{< ref "wiki/Winchester Madam Oink (Animatronic).md" >}}) was installed.

##History##

### Production ###
In August 1977, Pizza Time Theatre had finalized their 'Guest Star' concept with the creation of Helen Henny. They tasked Fantasy Forest with creating the Bot.

### At Winchester ###
The Bot was installed at the Pizza Time Theatre on [370 S Winchester Blvd.]({{< ref "wiki/San Jose, CA (370 S Winchester Blvd).md" >}}) on August 12th, 1977<ref>https://archive.org/details/atariincbusiness0000gold/page/256/mode/2up</ref>. The Bot was installed with the [Helen Henny Showtape]({{< ref "wiki/Helen Henny Showtape.md" >}}). The Bot was replaced in February 1978 when [Winchester Madam Oink]({{< ref "wiki/Winchester Madam Oink (Animatronic).md" >}}) was installed.

### Fate ###
The fate of Winchester Helen is unknown as no photos of The Bot at [Sunnyvale]({{< ref "wiki/Pizza Time Theatre Sunnyvale, CA Corporate Office.md" >}}), [Cupertino]({{< ref "wiki/Pizza Time Theatre Cupertino, CA Corporate Office.md" >}}), or any other PTT Corporate location have been found. The Bot is possibly the same as [Kooser Helen Henny]({{< ref "wiki/Kooser Helen Henny (Animatronic).md" >}}), as the bots share the same design. The bot was most likely destroyed during the move to the [Showbiz Pizza Time Corporate Office]({{< ref "wiki/Showbiz Pizza Time Corporate Office.md" >}})

##Design##
The Bot had long brown hair, brown eyes, yellow hands with red painted fingernails, a black necklace with a gold medallion, and wears a white shirt with a purple vest over it.
