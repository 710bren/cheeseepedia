**_Data**_ is a community-made term referring to important information or items relating to Chuck E. Cheese or Pizza Time Theatre history.

The term is usually used when discovering or archiving new items or information never seen before.

## History ##
The term originated from the _Showbiz Pizza Network_ Discord server, now called _Pizza Time Network_, around 2019, and has continued to be used by the community outside it. A similar term from the server **non-merch_<nowiki/>', referring to Chuck E. Cheese items not sold as merchandise, is usually used as a negative connotation for data. This is usually directed towards items stolen or acquired from a Chuck E. Cheese's store that otherwise through company policy should not have ended up in a customer's possession, mainly referring to animatronics taken out of the abandoned building or lifted from the dumpster during a remodel or closure.
