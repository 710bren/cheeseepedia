The Country Stage, also referred to sometimes as the 'barn stage', was a one of a kind stage design at the North Richland Hills, TX Showbiz Pizza location. This stage was created with the release of the Country Klunk showtape in January 1985.

Many Showbiz Pizza locations would receive decorations and cosmetics for the country theme, like cowboy hats for each character, but none would ever come close to the barn stage concept.
