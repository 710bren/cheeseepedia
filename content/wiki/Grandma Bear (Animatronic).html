Grandma Bear/Beatrice was created for the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Bear Country Jubilee" >}}">Bear Country Jubilee</a> which would be sold to Morey's Piers and Americana Amusement Park. Her mask mold and mech was later reused for Little Queenie in the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Wolf Pack 5" >}}">Wolf Pack 5</a>.
<h2> History </h2>
Grandma Bear/Beatrice along with the Bear Country Jubilee show was developed from 1977 - 1978. One show would be sold to Americana Amusement Park in Monroe, Ohio. The current whereabouts of the show is unknown. A 2nd show was sold to Morey's Piers in Wildwood, New Jersey. This show was sold back to CEI in 1984<sup><a href="1">1</a></sup> and currently resides at the CEI museum.
<h2> Design </h2>
In her design for Americana Amusement Park, she was dressed like a Southern belle with a hat with flowers in it, pink dress, and round rim glasses. Her head fur is also light grey while the rest of her had black fur. At Morey's Piers, she wore a red night gown, blue apron with various stitched patterns, and rectangle rim glasses. She wears a gray wig, her fur is also now uniform and dark gray.
<h2> Movements </h2>
Due to her mech being reused for the Wolf Pack 5, we have a better idea of her movements than the others.
