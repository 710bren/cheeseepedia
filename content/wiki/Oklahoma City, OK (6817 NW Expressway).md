##Stages##
When this location first opened, it featured a Rock-Afire Explosion. Unfortunately, there are no exterior and interior photos or videos of Expressway

It underwent concept unification in 1991 and removed the Rock-Afire Explosion with the 3-Stage. 

In 2000, the 3-Stage was removed for the Studio C Alpha stage.

##History##
Oklahoma City (Expressway) opened on January 27th, 1982 with a Rock-Afire Explosion stage. Oklahoma City (Expressway) would then receive the 1988 remodel remodeling the exterior, and removing older SPP decor for newer decor, and the change to the Billy Bob stage. In 1991, Oklahoma City (Expressway) would receive Concept Unification which removed all SPP decor for CEC decor, an exterior change now saying 'Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza', and the conversion of the Rock-Afire Explosion for the 3-Stage. In the Mid-90's, the older decor was removed for newer decor. In the Late 90's, Oklahoma City (Expressway) received the Phase 3 remodel removing the older 90's decor, adding newer decor, and the addition of SkyTubes. In 2000, the 3-Stage was removed for the Studio C Alpha. In 2006-2007, Oklahoma City (Expressway) received the 2005 remodel removing all older decor, and the addition of newer decor, another exterior remodel, and they also expanded the store. At some point between 2010-2011, the location expanded again. Oklahoma City (Expressway) would remain like this until the Fall of 2021 when they received the 2.0 remodel and removed all Phase 4 artwork for 2.0 artwork, another exterior change, and the removal of the Studio C Alpha for the Dance Floor and Video Wall. Currently, as of January 2023, the location still has the 2.0 remodel and the Dance Floor.
