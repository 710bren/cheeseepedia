**_Manchester, NH (1525 S Willow St),**_ is a Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre location that opened in August of 1982 with a Balcony Stage. It is located in the South Willow Plaza.
## Stages## 
When Manchester opened, it housed a Balcony stage. Sometime between 1989 and 1990, they installed a C-Stage. At this time, the Cyberamics were in alright condition. In 1992, during the peak of the 'Tux Chuck' era, the 2-Stage was Installed.

Between the 2000's, a [\2](\1) was installed. The stage housed a [\2](\1) animatronic, which was the most advanced animatronic in the history of CEC. Strangely, the exterior's text kept the Pizza Time Theatre font all the way up to it's Phase 4 remodel in 2006.

## History## 
### PTT Era### 
This store opened in August 1982 with a [[Balcony Stage]], which lasted all the way until around 1991 when the stage was replaced with a [[C-Stage]]. Sadly, there is no documentation of Manchester as a Pizza Time Theatre or Phase 2.
### 'Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza' Remodel### 
The remodel occured around the early 90's probably around 1991. The store got a new exterior and also got the colorful checkers, and also got the new C-Stage. They also got some new 90's decor like Mount Chuckmore and others. At some point in the mid 90's, they would replace the C-Stage with a 2-Stage. They would remain like this until the late 90's.
### Phase 3 Remodel### 
Sometime in the late 90's the Phase 3 remodel occured. Removing most of the 90's decor including Mount Chuckmore. They also got some newer decor like the Super Chuck and Andy Warhol Colorful Chuck posters and even got the SkyTubes. They would remain like this until around 2006. 
### Phase 4 Remodel### 
Around 2006 or 2007, they would receive the 2005 remodel which removed some of the decor and replaced the 2-Stage for the Studio C Beta. Currently, they still have the 2005 remodel and still have the Studio C Beta.
