{{Generic|image=NOTALOG.png|desc=CCMS as Simi Valley, Displaying Order Numbers}}The **_Color Call-out Monitor System**_ was  multi-store successor to the [NOTALOG]({{< ref "wiki/NOTALOG.md" >}}) system used at the first location, [San Jose, CA (370 S Winchester Blvd)]({{< ref "wiki/San Jose, CA (370 S Winchester Blvd).md" >}}).

## History ##
In September of 1981 the system would be acknowledged for the first and only time in [The Pizza Times (Vol. 1, Issue 2, September 1981)]({{< ref "wiki/The Pizza Times (Vol 1, Issue 2, September 1981).md" >}}), stating it to be a system that could display messages alongside order numbers on monitor displays.<ref>https://archive.org/details/the-pizza-times-newsletters/1981%20The%20Pizza%20Times%201-2/page/n1/mode/2up</ref> It is unclear when this system began to roll out to stores, or how many of them received it.

The only confirmed spotting of the CCMS was at [Simi Valley, CA (71 Tierra Rejada Rd)]({{< ref "wiki/Simi Valley, CA (71 Tierra Rejada Rd).md" >}}), a store built in late 1980. The system was still in use by 1986 at the store, likely being gutted in its 1990 remodeling.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNeLNeALLMM</ref>
