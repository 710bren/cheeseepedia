{{Generic|image=NOTALOG.png|desc=CCMS as Simi Valley, Displaying Order Numbers}}The **_Color Call-out Monitor System**_ was [\2](\1) multi-store successor to the [[NOTALOG]] system used at the first location, [[San Jose, CA (370 S Winchester Blvd)]].

##  History ## 
In September of 1981 the system would be acknowledged for the first and only time in [[The Pizza Times (Vol. 1, Issue 2, September 1981)]], stating it to be a system that could display messages alongside order numbers on monitor displays.<ref>https://archive.org/details/the-pizza-times-newsletters/1981%20The%20Pizza%20Times%201-2/page/n1/mode/2up</ref> It is unclear when this system began to roll out to stores, or how many of them received it.

The only confirmed spotting of the CCMS was at [[Simi Valley, CA (71 Tierra Rejada Rd)]], a store built in late 1980. The system was still in use by 1986 at the store, likely being gutted in its 1990 remodeling.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNeLNeALLMM</ref>
