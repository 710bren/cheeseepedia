<b><i>Pizza Time Theatre Cashiering</b></i> is one of the first <i>Pizza Time Theatre</i> training tapes, released on December 30, 1981, and used until sometime in 1984.  

This tape, along with the 'Pizza Cook' training tape, utilized the Videotronic Super 8mm cartridge system. A magnetic sound cartridge system that saw the most success used for commercial applications. The tape focused on the cashiering portion of an employee's job. It is unknown whether this video had any audio, though it potentially did because of the Videotronic Super 8mm cartridge systems sound capability.  

<h2> PTT Training Center </h2>
The tape was part of the [PTT Training Center & Test Kitchen]({{< ref "wiki/PTT Training Center & Test Kitchen.html" >}}) program held exclusively at the [San Jose, CA (2445 Fontaine Rd)]({{< ref "wiki/San Jose, CA (2445 Fontaine Rd).html" >}}) location, potentially meaning only one copy was ever made. The tape was also part of a set of training tapes, with the only other one known being the Pizza Time Theatre 'Pizza Cook' tape.
