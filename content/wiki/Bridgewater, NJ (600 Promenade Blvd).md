[\2](\1)
**_600 Promenade Blvd**_ is a Chuck E. Cheese's that opened on February 7, 2000 with a [\2](\1) and is still open today with the stage. This location is known for having the last Interactive Console in existence, as all others have been removed.

##  Stages ## 
Bridgewater opened with a Studio C Alpha, like all other locations at the time. However, when they received the Ticket Blaster in 2010, the Interactive Console remains behind, although as of today, it has a lot of broken features.

##  History ## 
On February 7, 2000, Bridgewater's Chuck E. Cheese's opened to the public. It originally had [\2](\1), which included late 90s decor, [\2](\1). Unfortunately, information on Bridgewater as a 1990s styled store is scarce. In the late 2000s, they received the (interior only) 2003 update to the [[2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative]], which involved removing all 90s decor for new decor, removing the showroom walls, painting many walls purple, and slightly changed the counters. Around 2015-2017, the Phase 3 exterior was switched out for a 2015 exterior, which included purple awnings and a Rockstar Chuck logo. The Skytubes were removed not long after as well. As of July 2023, Bridgewater remains operational.
