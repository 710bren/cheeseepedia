## History ##
On February 7, 2000, Bridgewater's Chuck E. Cheese's opened to the public. It originally had , which included late 90s decor, . Unfortunately, information on Bridgewater as a 1990s styled store is scarce. In the late 2000s, they received the (interior only) 2003 update to the [2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative]({{< ref "wiki/2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration  Major Remodel Initiative.md" >}}), which involved removing all 90s decor for new decor, removing the showroom walls, painting many walls purple, and slightly changed the counters. Around 2015-2017, the Phase 3 exterior was switched out for a 2015 exterior, which included purple awnings and a Rockstar Chuck logo. The Skytubes were removed not long after as well. As of July 2023, Bridgewater remains operational.
