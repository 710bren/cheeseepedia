Winchester Crusty the Cat V2 was the upgraded Crusty the Cat animatronic used at the [San Jose Winchester]({{< ref "wiki/San Jose, CA (370 S Winchester Blvd).md" >}}) location used from 1978 to 1980, when Crusty would be retired and replaced with Mr. Munch. 

### Design ###
Crusty V2 is a fully animated figure, as opposed to the previous iteration, which was a flat figure. His arms are now able to move, and he holds a baseball bat. His eyes are now more cat-like in appearance.

### Movements ###

* Mouth
* Eyelids
* Left arm raise
* Right arm swing

### After Retirement ###
After his retirement, Crusty was moved to the collection of Paul Linden, who was an executive with Pizza Time Theatre. Linden actually didn't know that Crusty had ever made it into a store and was a prototype character.

In 2012, Crusty was sold to Travis Schafer, who also owned Winchester Chuck E. Cheese V2 (Animatronic) (Winchester Chuck E. Cheese V2). Schafer was able to replace Crusty's shirt, which had gone missing at some point.  He also managed to recreate the backdrop that Crusty featured in store.


In 2022, Crusty was moved to the house of Pikalove, where he is today.
