<b><i>SongCode</b></i> was an animatronic programming system made for Pizza Time Theatre, running from 1978 to 1990.
The first known usage would be at the second location <a href="{{< ref "wiki/San Jose, CA (1371 Kooser Rd)" >}}">San Jose, CA (1371 Kooser Rd)</a>, with its hardware detailed in the SongCode Control System.
It was used to animate the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Kooser PTT Show" >}}">Kooser PTT Show</a>, <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics" >}}">Cyberamics</a>, and later <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Rock-afire Explosion" >}}">Rock-afire Explosion</a> showtapes throughout the late 80's. The <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Animation Programming System" >}}">Animation Programming System</a> (APS) would replace it in 1990, staying as the main programming software till present day.
<h2> Software </h2>
The software was written in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11_architecture"> PDP-11 CISC Architecture</a> for the main PDP-11, and later PDP-11/23, that ran it. Due to the PDP-11 having 16-bit hardware, its engineers were able to expand the unit's memory with an external device to be 32k of onboard memory.
By 1978 most PDP-11 users created programs on Unix 6th Edition, which could mean SongCode was written in the C Language, though the possibility of the program being written in raw Assembly or other languages is still possible.
<h2> Encoding Format </h2>
The format is believed to be an earlier variation of what would later appear in the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Studio C 3x DVD + Floppy" >}}">Studio C 3x DVD + Floppy</a> showtape format, being a command-based structure, rather than a snapshot based one.
