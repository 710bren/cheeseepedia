## History ##
### Showbiz ###

This store originally began as a Showbiz Pizza Place on May 31st, 1983 (Actual opening date not found yet) with The Rock-afire Explosion.

### Tux Chuck and Cool Chuck Eras ###
In around 1991, Roanoke underwent Concept Unification, and The Rock-afire was replaced by Munch's Make Believe Band, complete with all of the characters including extras such as Building, Moon, Wink, Pizzacam, and Munch Jr. Chuck E. wore his signature black tuxedo and red derby hat. The latex masks were all replaced by plastic masks pre-2003. In the 2000s, Chuck E.'s tux and derby were replaced by a red cap with a black 'C', a blue shirt with a yellow 'C', and khaki shorts (Cool Chuck outfit). The stage had working curtains up until curtains were no longer programmed. Intrestingly, Munch Jr. was removed sometime before 2003. Building & Moon functioned until around 2016-2017. 

### Avenger Era ###
In Around 2006-2007, the store recieved a Phase 4 Remodel.

In Mid 2012, the store recieved a major expansion which involved raising the ceilings and a new facade that new stores recieved at the time.

### Present Day ###
Roanoke features a 3-Stage with Pizzacam & Building (Behind Helen and is currently not functioning). This store was the last location in the state of Virginia to have the Pizzacam animatronic.

As of July 2022, the store is in the proccess of getting the 2.0 remodel which involves the removal of the 3-Stage for a Dance Floor & Video Wall.
