<h2>=Showbiz</h2>=
Roanoke opened as the 1st Showbiz Pizza Place in Virginia, they originally featured the Rock-Afire Explosion, as all other Showbiz locations did. they would have it for a few years. It is unknown if they ever remodeled when they were Showbiz.

<h2>=Tux Chuck and Cool Chuck Eras</h2>=
In around 1991, Roanoke underwent Concept Unification, and The Rock-afire was replaced by Munch's Make Believe Band, complete with all of the characters including extras such as Building, Moon, Wink, Pizzacam, and Munch Jr. Chuck E. wore his signature black tuxedo and red derby hat. The latex masks were all replaced by plastic masks pre-2003. In the 2000s, Chuck E.'s tux and derby were replaced by a red cap with a black 'C', a blue shirt with a yellow 'C', and khaki shorts (Cool Chuck outfit). The stage had working curtains up until curtains were no longer programmed. Interestingly, Munch Jr. was removed sometime before 2003. Building & Moon functioned until around 2016-2017. 

<h2>= Avenger Era</h2>=
In 2005, the store received the 2005 Remodel which involved the removal of Showroom Walls, Balcony Seating, & adding purple walls.

In Mid 2012, the store received a major expansion which involved raising the ceilings and a new facade that new stores received at the time. This also added more space for games and a new entrance on the left hand side of the store.

Roanoke featured a 3-Stage with Pizzacam (Later Retro-Cam) & Building (Behind Helen and wasn't not functioning before removal). This store was the last location in the state of Virginia to have the Pizzacam animatronic.
