****Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza**** was exterior signage produced for ShowBiz Pizza Time Inc from around 1987 to 1995 for the [SPT 1988 Remodel Program]({{< ref "wiki/SPT 1988 Remodel Program.md" >}}). 

## Usage ##
The first known usage of this signage would be at the [Silver Spring, MD (13807 Outlet Dr)]({{< ref "wiki/Silver Spring, MD (13807 Outlet Dr).md" >}}) store after it was one of the first stores to receive the 1988 Remodel as a test in 1987. It would continue to be used afterwards on existing Pizza Time Theater stores, existing showbiz stores that underwent Concept Unification,  and new stores that opened between 1990-1995.

There would be a few variants of this signage used throughout its lifespan.

The signage would be seen accompanied by two smaller signs next to the main sign which read 'Family' and 'Fun' at the Louisville, KY location.  There were also many unique variants used at some locations during its lifespan.
