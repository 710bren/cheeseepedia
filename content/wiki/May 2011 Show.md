##Trivia##
*This is the first of two shows (originally three) where Robert Gotcher provides the voice for Jasper following Jeremy Blaido's brief departure from the role. Previously, Robert has been Jasper's speaking voice for [Environment '92]({{< ref "wiki/Environment '92.md" >}}).
*Prior to landing on Robert, Duncan Brannan was considered to become Jasper's new voice. Duncan had previously done Jasper's singing in [Let The Good Times Roll]({{< ref "wiki/Let The Good Times Roll.md" >}}) and voiced him for [Chuck E's Magical Holiday Celebration]({{< ref "wiki/Chuck E's Magical Holiday Celebration.md" >}}), [Chuck E's Jukebox Jam Show]({{< ref "wiki/Chuck E's Jukebox Jam Show.md" >}}) and a brief bit of dialogue during 'Sharp Dressed Mouse' in the [August 1997 Show]({{< ref "wiki/August 1997 Show.md" >}}).
*During segment four, a character named 'Jiggawatt' (played by Matt Daniel) is introduced for the purpose of creating song mashups. His name is a reference to 'Jigowatt' from [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_to_the_Future Back to the Future] . After this show 'Jiggawatt' is never seen or mentioned again.
*Unused footage exists of the walkaround costumes dancing in front of a DeLorean. This was originally going to be used during the fourth segment when 'Jiggawatt' plays a mashup of the vocals from 'Walk The Dinosaur' and the instrumental from 'We Got The Beat'.
**”Don’t You Wanna Share”,”The Weekend”,”Never A Long Goodbye” were all written by Dave Wilson for this show, “The Place To Be was written by Robert Gotcher.
