<p><b><i>7401 Good Hope Rd</b></i> was a <i>ShowBiz Pizza Place</i>/<i>Chuck E. Cheese's</i> that opened on June 17th, 1981, as a ShowBiz Pizza Place with a Rock-afire Explosion. Good Hope would subsequently close in 1985 with other unprofitable stores and reopen the same year as a Chuck E. Cheese’s. The store closed in 1995 (Unknown Month and Day) with a 1-Stage. It was located next to a Kmart in the former Kmart Foods space.</p>
<p><h2> Stages </h2></p>
<p>Originally, Good Hope featured a Rock-afire Explosion, as all other Showbiz locations did. In 1985, Good Hope would close and would remove the Rock-afire Explosion. Good Hope reopened the same year with a Balcony Stage, and around 1988 would replace it with Chuck E.'s House. They would then convert Chuck E.'s House into a 1-Stage. They had the 1-Stage until the store's closure sometime in 1995. It is unknown what happened to the stage after Good Hope closed.</p>

<p><h2> History </h2></p>
<p>Good Hope opened on June 17th, 1981 as the first ShowBiz Pizza Place in Wisconsin as a corporate-owned store in the space that once housed a Kmart Foods Grocery Store. Good Hope originally featured the Rock-afire Explosion, as all other ShowBiz locations did. Good Hope would have it for a few years, until 1985, when the store would close due to being unprofitable and the show was removed and sent to <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Raleigh, NC (3501-131 Capital Blvd)" >}}">Raleigh</a> (It would then undergo Concept Unification in 1991, and be removed in 2022). Good Hope would reopen as a franchised Chuck E. Cheese’s store, owned by the same franchisee as the three other stores in the area. Good Hope would feature a Balcony Stage until it would was replaced with <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House" >}}">Chuck E.'s House</a> in around 1988, when they would also receive the 1986 SPT Remodel Program. Good Hope was one of three ShowBiz Pizza stores to get this stage, the other two being <a href="{{< ref "wiki/White Settlement, TX (7750 Scott St)" >}}">White Settlement</a> (Which got it after they reopened, like Good Hope) and <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Citrus Heights, CA (6251 Sunrise Blvd)" >}}">Citrus Heights</a>. They would have it until sometime in 1994 when it is believed that they received the 1994 SPT Repositioning / Remodel Program which involved the conversion of <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House" >}}">Chuck E.'s House</a> to a 1-Stage. Good Hope would remain this way until the store was permanently closed a year later in 1995 for unknown reasons. The whole building, including the neighboring Kmart would then be demolished for a Home Depot for 2005, which closed in 2008. The site is now a Pick 'n Save. As of May 2023, Pick 'n Save is still in the building.</p>
