## History ##

### Origins & Showbiz Pizza Place ###
Antioch was originally referred to as the Birthday Spider, and held a cake in-between his hands. Over time, he would become 's pet spider. He would pop down occasionally and speak to Fatz in a garbled language that only they could understand. During [Concept Unification]({{< ref "wiki/Concept Unification.md" >}}){< ref "wiki/Concept Unification.md" >}}), Antioch would be destroyed. Antioch was named after the first Showbiz Pizza Place location in [Kansas City, MO (2726 NE Vivion Rd)]({{< ref "wiki/Kansas City, MO (2726 NE Vivion Rd).md" >}}).

### Present Day ###
Original parts for Antioch would start to be reproduced by Creative Engineering's new employees in 2023.
