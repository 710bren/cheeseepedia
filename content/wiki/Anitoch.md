**_Antioch**_ is one of the prop characters in the [[Rock-afire Explosion]], having made his debut as an animatronic at [[Jacksonville, FL (9820 Atlantic Blvd)]].

##  History ## 

###  Origins & Showbiz Pizza Place ### 
Antioch was originally referred to as the Birthday Spider, and held a cake in-between his hands. Over time, he would become [\2](\1)'s pet spider. He would pop down occasionally and speak to Fatz in a garbled language that only they could understand. During [[Concept Unification]], Antioch would be destroyed. Antioch was named after the first Showbiz Pizza Place location in [[Kansas City, MO (2726 NE Vivion Rd)]].

###  Present Day ### 
Original parts for Antioch would start to be reproduced by Creative Engineering's new employees in 2023.
