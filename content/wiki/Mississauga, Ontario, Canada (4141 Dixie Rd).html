<h2>History</h2>
Mississauga (Dixie) opened its doors in Spring 1991 as the tenth Chuck E. Cheese store in Canada. it was also the 2nd and last franchised store in Canada. Fortunately, there is a ton of documentation of Mississauga (Dixie) back then. In the early-mid 90's, Mississauga (Dixie) underwent a minor remodel that removed a little decor for newer decor. Around the Late 90's, the location received the 'Phase 2' remodel removing older 90's decor, adding newer decor, another exterior change, and SkyTubes. On December 20th, 1998, the location was sold to corporate along with [Willowdale (North York/Toronto)]({{< ref "wiki/Willowdale, Ontario, Canada (2452 Sheppard Ave).md" >}}), Wisconsin locations of [Milwaukee]({{< ref "wiki/Milwaukee, WI (2701 S Chase Ave).md" >}}), [West Allis]({{< ref "wiki/West Allis, WI (2990 South 108th Ave).md" >}}), [Brookfield]({{< ref "wiki/Brookfield, WI (19125 W Blue Mound Rd).md" >}}), and [Amherst, NY]({{< ref "wiki/Amherst, NY (4994 Harlem Rd).md" >}}). Mississauga (Dixie) would remain like this until 2006-2007 when they received the 2005 remodel, however this would only be on the exterior until 2008 when they updated the interior, removing the Showroom Walls, Balcony Seating, removing the Late 90's and early 2000's decor for newer decor. Currently, as of August 2024, the location still has the 2005 remodel and the last Road Stage along with the last banjo for Jasper at a location.
