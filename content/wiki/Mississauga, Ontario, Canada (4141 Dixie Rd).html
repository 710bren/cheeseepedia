<h2>History</h2>
Mississauga (Dixie) opened its doors in Spring 1991 as the tenth Chuck E. Cheese store in Canada. it was also the 2nd and last franchised store in Canada. Fortunately, there is a ton of documentation of Mississauga (Dixie) back then. In the early-mid 90's, Mississauga (Dixie) underwent a minor remodel that removed a little decor for newer decor. Around the Late 90's, the location received the 'Phase 2' remodel removing older 90's decor, adding newer decor, another exterior change, and SkyTubes. On December 20th, 1998, the location was sold to corporate along with <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Willowdale, Ontario, Canada (2452 Sheppard Ave)" >}}">Willowdale (North York/Toronto)</a>, Wisconsin locations of <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Milwaukee, WI (2701 S Chase Ave)" >}}">Milwaukee</a>, <a href="{{< ref "wiki/West Allis, WI (2990 South 108th Ave)" >}}">West Allis</a>, <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Brookfield, WI (19125 W Blue Mound Rd)" >}}">Brookfield</a>, and <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Amherst, NY (4994 Harlem Rd)" >}}">Amherst, NY</a>.
