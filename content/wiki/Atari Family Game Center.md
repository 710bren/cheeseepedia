The **_Atari Family Game Center**_ (Also known as the **_Atari Leisure Time Game Center**_<ref>https://www.ataricompendium.com/archives/documents/press_kits/atari_leisure_time_game_center.pdf</ref> and **_Atari Game Center**_<ref>https://www.newspapers.com/image/717528185/?match=1&terms=atari%20game%20center</ref>), was a set of mall arcades predating the [[Pizza Time Theatre]] concept from April of 1974 to Spring of 1975.<ref>https://mcurrent.name/atarihistory/syzygy.html</ref>

The arcades would exclusively house Atari arcade games, built with custom cabinets to fit the interior design of the locations. The locations would also offer pinball machines and a variety of board games to play. Patrons could also purchase their own Atari arcades from the store for individual use or for small private organizations.<ref name=':0'>https://www.ataricompendium.com/archives/interviews/jerry_donaldson/interview_jerry_donaldson.html</ref><ref>https://flyers.arcade-museum.com/videogames/show/5730#gallery</ref>
