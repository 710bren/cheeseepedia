## History ##
Memphis was an average PTT, having a Fantasy Forest, Beverages Stand and Balcony Stage. When it first opened, it had no backdrops or theme for it's stage. The backdrops and wild west theme were added later. In 1983, Chuck got a new updated vest (previously a prototype 1 vest) but then in 1984, he switched back to his original vest. The known backgrounds were the wild west background and the 1984 Helen Henny background. This location was also bought back by corporate in 1983 due to poor sales. It closed due to the bankruptcy and showbiz locations opening nearby. All animatronics, games, rides, and other store equipment were auctioned off.

## Animatronics ##
This location had an earlier version of the Balcony Stage cyberamics consisting of Mr Munch, Jasper T. Jowls, Chuck E. Cheese, Harmony Howlett, and Chef Pasqually. Some other cyberamics were the Warblettes, Applause Board, Drum Board, and Flag Wavers. The first known guest stars were Harmony Howlett (added during grand opening), Madame Oink (replaced harmony in 1983) and Helen Henny (replaced Madame in 1984). They featured one of the first, 'The King' animatronic instead of Dolly Dimples.
