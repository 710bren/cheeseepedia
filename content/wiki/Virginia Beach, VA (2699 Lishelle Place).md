<h2>History </h2>
Virginia Beach originally opened on November 23rd, 1983, as the 3rd Showbiz Pizza Store in Virginia as a Franchised location. Virginia Beach originally featured the Rock-Afire Explosion, as all other Showbiz locations did. they would have it for a few years, until around 1991 or 1992, when they would receive the 1988 remodel, receiving Concept Unification, where the Rock-Afire Explosion characters were changed to the Chuck E. Cheese characters, and removing all SPP decor for newer decor. They first closed sometime in 1995 when they were converted into a FEC named Billy Bobs which the show was converted back into the Rock Afire Explosion along with [Lynchburg, VA]({{< ref "wiki/Lynchburg, VA (312 Border St).md" >}}) and [Fayetteville, NC]({{< ref "wiki/Fayetteville, NC (511 North McPherson Church Rd).md" >}}). In March 1997 (After 1-2 years), Virginia Beach reopened as a Franchised location with a reused 2-Stage from possibly the [Johnson City, NY]({{< ref "wiki/Johnson City, NY (365 Harry L Dr).md" >}}) location. The store was bought out by Corporate on February 9th, 2001. Around the 2006/2007, Virginia Beach remodeled to the 2005 Update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative. The Gameroom would be expanded a few years later. They in May 2022, they started their 2017 2.0 Remodel Program (2.0 Remodel) which involved the removal of the 2-Stage for a 2021 Model Dance Floor + Video Wall. As of April 2023, Virginia Beach still has the 2.0 Remodel and 2021 Model Dance Floor + Video Wall.
