This location Opened As a SPP on November 23rd, 1983 and around 1990 it was converted to a CEC Pizza and kept its 3 Stage and remained that way until 1995. When they were transformed into a FEC named Billy Bobs which reskinned the 3 Stage show back into the Rock Afire Explosion along with [Lynchburg, VA (312 Border St)]({{< ref "wiki/Lynchburg, VA (312 Border St).md" >}}) and [Fayetteville, NC (511 North McPherson Church Rd)]({{< ref "wiki/Fayetteville, NC (511 North McPherson Church Rd).md" >}}). They reopened as a CEC in March 1997 which supposedly got a 2 Stage with PTT bots from Johnson City NY! Around the 2000s they got the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative. And they expanded the Gameroom a little bit. They in May 2022 they started their 2017 2.0 Remodel Program which got rid of the 2 Stage. They still remain like this to this day.
