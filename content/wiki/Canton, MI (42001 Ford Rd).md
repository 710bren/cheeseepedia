**_42001 Ford Rd, Store #80**_ is a _Chuck E. Cheese_ in Canton, Michigan.

## History## 
Canton opened in an unnamed shopping center with a [\2](\1) which had the checkers around the store, blue & white awnings, and neon signage. The store would remain this way until 1993/1994 when they would receive [\2](\1) of the [[1994 SPT Repositioning / Remodel Program]] which involved removing elements of the 1988 Remodel, converting [[Chuck E.'s House]] into a 2-Stage (Which moved the show from the left side wall to the back wall), and an exterior change.

## Stages## 
When Canton first opened, the location opened with [[Chuck E.'s House]] which was the only one installed in the state which was located on the left side wall. In 1993/1994, it was converted into a [[2-Stage), moving the show to the back wall. They would have the 2-Stage until August 2022 when it was removed for a 2021 Model Dance Floor & Video Wall.
