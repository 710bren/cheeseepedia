<b><i>42001 Ford Rd, Store #80</b></i> is a <i>Chuck E. Cheese</i> in Canton, Michigan that opened on May 3rd, 1988, with a Chuck E's House and is still open to this day with a 2.0 remodel and dance floor.

<h2>History</h2>
Canton opened in an unnamed shopping center with a [Chuck E.'s House]({{< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House.md" >}}) (The only one installed in Michigan) on May 3rd, 1988. When the store opened, they had the 1986 SPT Remodel Program (1988 Remodel) which had the checkers around the store, blue & white awnings, and neon signage. The store would remain this way until 1993/1994 when they would receive [Phase 1]({{< ref "wiki/Phase 1 (1994).md" >}}) of the 1994 SPT Repositioning / Remodel Program which involved removing elements of the 1988 Remodel, converting [Chuck E.'s House]({{< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House.md" >}}) into a 2-Stage (Which moved the show from the left side wall to the back wall), and an exterior change. In November 2006, Canton would remodel to the 2005 Update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative which involved removing the Showroom Walls, Balcony Seating, Dim Lights, 1990s decor, and a major exterior facade renovation. Sometime in 2008, the exterior was renovated even further along with the rest of the plaza. In July/August 2022, Canton would start their 2017 2.0 Remodel Program (2.0 Remodel) which involved the 2-Stage being replaced with a 2021 model Dance Floor & Video Wall. As of April 2023, Canton still has the 2,0 Remodel, 2021 model Dance Floor, & Video Wall.

<h2>Stages</h2>
When Canton first opened, the location opened with [Chuck E.'s House]({{< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House.md" >}}) which was the only one installed in the state which was located on the left side wall. In 1993/1994, it was converted into a [2-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/2-Stage.md" >}}), moving the show to the back wall. They would have the 2-Stage until August 2022 when it was removed for a 2021 Model Dance Floor & Video Wall. As of April 2023, Canton still has their 2021 model Dance Floor & Video Wall.
