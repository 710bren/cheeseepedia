[[File:BradentonBalcony.jpg|thumb|Bradentonâ€™s Balcony Stage in 1981.]]
**_4420 14th St**_ was a _Pizza Time Theatre_ that opened in October 1981 and closed on June 16th, 1984.

This location is not to be confused with [Bradenton, FL (415 Cortez Rd)]({{< ref "wiki/Bradenton, FL (415 Cortez Rd).md" >}}) or [Bradenton, FL (905 44th Ave)]({{< ref "wiki/Bradenton, FL (905 44th Ave).md" >}}).

## History ##
Bradenton opened with Harmony Howlette and presumably The King. Bradenton would later get Madame Oink, and of course Helen who stayed until Bradenton relocated. This was the sixth Pizza Time Theatre to open in the state of Florida.

After Bradenton closed on June 16th, 1984, the store had an auction like most PTTs. The standalone building was reoccupied by Olive Garden, which is still open to this day.
