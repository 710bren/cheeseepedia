_The **Black Fantasy Forest Game Preserve**_ sign first appeared at the second Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre on [1371 Kooser Road]({{< ref "wiki/San Jose, CA (1371 Kooser Rd).md" >}}) located in the Blossom Hill Shopping Center in San Jose California, placed above one of the multiple Fantasy Forest entrances from December 1978 to most likely the 1981 Remodel.

## Production ##
While no specific data is documented on the production of the sign like many other fixtures from the era, we can assume it was either produced by a contracting company, or made in-house by Pizza Time Theatre Incorporated.

## Usage ##

The only known instance of the sign within Pizza Time Theatre stores was at the second Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre on 1371 Kooser Road, where it was used from 1978 to presumably 1981.  

## Design ##
This fixture displays 'Fantasy Forest Game Preserve' in yellow text on a black sign, alongside a yellow Chuck E. Cheese head, which was often used in the time period for marketing.
