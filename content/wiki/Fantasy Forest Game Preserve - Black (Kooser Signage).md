_The **Black Fantasy Forest Game Preserve**_ sign first appeared at the second Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre on 1371 Kooser Road, placed above the Fantasy Forest entrance from 1978 to an unknown date, presumably after the balcony stage installation.

## Production ##
Not much is known about the production of this sign, although it is known that it was produced as early as October 1979.

## Usage ##

The only known instance of the sign within Pizza Time Theatre stores was first made known of in the October 1979 issue of Food Service Marketing,<ref>ptt_79fsm.pdf (showbizpizza.com)</ref> where it can be seen behind the main title text. It is not known if it was used multiple times throughout the restaurant, or if it was used in multiple Pizza Time Theatre locations. 

## Design ##
This fixture displays 'Fantasy Forest Game Preserve' in yellow text on a black sign, alongside a yellow Chuck E. Cheese head, which was often used in the time period for marketing. 

## Gallery ##
TBD.
