**5106 West Waco Drive** was a [[Chuck E. Cheese's]] that opened on June 24, 2002 with a [[Small-Town Studio C Prototype]], which is still open to this day.

Waco received either the first or second [\2](\1) in the Summer of 2003, and received the [\2](\1) in October 2022.

##  History ## 

###  PTT 1983-1984; Showbiz 1983/86-1992 ### 
Before the current Waco store opened, there was a Pizza Time Theatre in Waco, located at [\2](\1). This location was very short lived, being opened from 1983 until October of 1984, when it would close because of Pizza Time Theatre, Inc.'s bankrupty earlier in the year.

There was also a Showbiz Pizza Place in Waco, located at [\2](\1). This location lasted slightly more longer than the PTT, being open between 1983 and 1986 and closing in 1992 as a result of refusing Concept Unification.

###  Chuck E. Cheese's 2002-2022 ### 
On June 24th, 2002 a new Chuck E. Cheese's opened in Waco, this time located at 5106 West Waco Drive. This new Waco location was the first of 3 stores to install the [[Small-Town Studio C Prototype]], which featured no animatronic, and instead featured a Blue Screen and a buffet. Waco would remain with their Small-Town Studio C Prototype until July 2003, when they would receive either the first or the second [[Small-Town Studio C]] (aka Studio C Cappa), and remove the buffet. They would receive the 2005 Remodel (Phase 4) sometime in the 2000's, and would keep their Phase 4 until October 2022.

###  Chuck E. Cheese 2022-Present ### 
In October 2022, 20 years after the store opened, Waco would receive 2.0 in which the Small-Town Studio C would be removed and replaced with a [[Chuck E. Live Stage (Dance Floor)]] and Video Wall. As of January 2023, they still have the 2.0 Remodel.

##  Stages ## 
When Waco opened, they were the first of 3 stores (The 2 others being Lake Jackson, Texas and Dover, Delaware.) to receive the [[Small-Town Studio C Prototype]], which was a stage created for the 3 'Small-Town CEC' test stores (Waco, Lake Jackson, and Dover), although it only contained a Blue Screen (used on Studio C stages of the time.), 3 TVs, and lights.

In July 2003, Waco received either the first or second Small-Town Studio C (also known as Studio C Cappa). Waco's Cappa was unique in that where the Blue Screen would be on other Cappas was instead a unique panel that said CEC and had lights on the sides.

In October 2022, Waco received the 2.0 Remodel, removing their [\2](\1) and Video Wall. As of January 2023, Waco still has the Dance Floor and Video Wall.
