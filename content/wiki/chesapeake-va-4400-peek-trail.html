<b><i>4400 Peek Trail</b></i> is a <i>Chuck E. Cheese's</i> that opened in early 2004 (month and day unknown) with a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Studio C Beta" >}}">Studio C Beta</a>, 16M and is still open today with the 2.0 remodel.
This is not to be confused with <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Chesapeake, VA (1528 Sam's Circle)" >}}">Chesapeake, VA (1528 Sam's Circle)</a>, which opened in December 1996 (day unknown) with a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/2-Stage" >}}">2-Stage</a> and is still open to this day with 2.0.
<h2> Stages </h2>
Peek Trail at first had a Studio C Beta with a 16M bot. Around 2005, the curtains were disabled, in 2013, Chuck's cap was removed, and then in August 2022, they received 2.0, removing the Beta for a 2021 model Dance Floor and Video Wall.

<h2> History </h2>
Peek Trail opened in early 2004 (month and day unknown) with the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Phase 3 (2000)" >}}">Phase 3</a> remodel, which included some late 1990s-early 2000s decor, <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Skytubes" >}}">Skytubes</a>, and a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Studio C Beta" >}}">Studio C Beta</a> with a 16M bot. This location did not receive the 2005 remodel at any point and was untouched throughout the years. By the late 2010s, the Skytubes were removed. This location was also the very last location to have wall planters. Around August 2022, Peek Trail received the 2.0 remodel, removing the Beta after 18 years and a 2021 Model Dance Floor and Video Wall took its place. As of July 2023, Peek Trail still has the 2.0 remodel.
