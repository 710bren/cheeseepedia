<h2> History </h2>
San Bruno opened on May 30, 1994 with the SPT 1992/1993 Remodel Program and [1-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/1-Stage.html" >}}). We donâ€™t know when they received the [[Phase 1 (1994)|Phase I]], [[Phase 2 (1997)|Phase II]], and [[Phase 3 (2000)|Phase III]] game packages, but they probably receive all of them at one point. In 2007, San Bruno would receive the [CEC 2005 Remodel Program]({{< ref "wiki/CEC 2005 Remodel Program.html" >}}). In 2019, the location would receive the [CEC 2018 2.0 Remodel Program]({{< ref "wiki/CEC 2018 20 Remodel Program.html" >}}), removing the 1-Stage for a 2019 Model[[Chuck E. Live Stage (Dance Floor)| Dance Floor]]. As of September 2023, San Bruno still has the 2.0 remodel.
