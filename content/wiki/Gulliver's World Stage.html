<p>Gulliver's World has a retrofitted <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Rock-afire Explosion" >}}">Rock-AFire Explosion</a> show renamed to 'The Hard Luck Bears' and is located in its own theater. the character positioning is the same to the original Rock-afire Explosion set-up except the characters themselves feature different clothing and all have replacement bear masks.</p>
<p><h2> History </h2></p>
<p>TODO: go in depth</p>
<p>The show was installed by Creative Engineering Inc. in 1992 and ran off its own custom programmed showtape produced by Gulliver's and programmed by Creative Engineering Inc.</p>
<p><h3> Restoration </h3></p>
<p>On 27 February 2022 Instagram user 'xan_rock_afire_fan' announced that he would be restoring all 3 of Gulliver's Hard Luck Bears shows.<sup>[1]</sup> The restoration included a full mechanical restoration, a switch to the 'BlueBox' control system and the same year the show had a soft-opening for Christmas.<sup>[2]</sup> (Though during this soft-opening the characters weren't 100% mechanically).</p>
<p>In November 2023 internet user BensProjects created a new dress for Mitzi this features a red shirt with snow flake patterns and a white overall-skirt, she was also given blue pom-poms.</p>
<p>On 2024/05/26 the show began to go through a wiring re-vamp changing its power system to fully run of 50HZ European power and not using a step down power converter. This also included the process of changing every light to LED instead of the original Halogen lights.</p>
