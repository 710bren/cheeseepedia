##History##
North Richland Hills opened its doors in April 7th, 1982 with a Rock-afire Explosion show. It was originally and currently a corporate-owned store. Like many other ShowBiz Pizza locations, it had a typical SPP layout seen in many other stores across the United States and would eventually receive the 1988 remodel years after it would open. Although very little documentation exists back in the ShowBiz days, it can be determined that North Richland Hills was one of several locations to receive an Uncle Klunk show package (and a Santa Claus retrofit package as well) sometime after opening. Like many ShowBiz locations in the late 1980s, North Richland Hills received the Showbiz Pizza Campground upgrade.

In around 1991/1992, North Richland Hills received Concept Unification which converted the show to Munch's Make Believe Band. In around the Mid-Late 1990's, North Richland received either [https://chuckepedia.com/wiki/Phase_1_(1994) Phase 1] or [https://chuckepedia.com/wiki/Phase_2_(1997) Phase 2] remodel which removed some early 90's decor and added new decor and SkyTubes. In 2000, North Richland Hills received the Phase 3 remodel which removed the 3-Stage for the Studio C Alpha. North Richland Hills remained this way until sometime in 2006-2007 when they received the 2005 Remodel which involved removing the Showroom Walls, balcony Seating, and received a new exterior and also removing some older 90's decor. Around 2010, they would expand the store, removing more old decor and adding new games and tables. As of January 2023, they still have the Alpha stage and the red poles that were from the store's pre-expansion.
