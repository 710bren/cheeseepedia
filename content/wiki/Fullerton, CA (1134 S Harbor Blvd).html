<b><i>1134 S Harbor Blvd, Store #325</b></i> was a <i>Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza</i> located in Fullerton, California which opened on December 17, 1991, with a 3-Stage and closed on November 17, 2020.

Fullerton was the first location (and one of three) to open with a 3-Stage, the others being Tallahassee, Florida (2810 Sharer Rd) which opened in April 1992, and Guatemala City, Guatemala (Liberacion), which opened in 1996 with Guatemala City (Avenida)'s 3-Stage (Which was originally from the [[Terre Haute, IN (3820 S US Hwy 41)|Terre Haute, IN]] Showbiz Pizza location), as well as a 2-Stage. Liberacion would close in 2016. 

This is not to be confused with the [Fullerton, CA (1841 W Orangethorpe Ave)]({{< ref "wiki/Fullerton, CA (1841 W Orangethorpe Ave).html" >}}) Pizza Time Theatre which opened in March 1980 and closed in 1985 with a [[Cyberamics Portrait Stage|Portrait Stage]]. 

<h2>History</h2>
<h2>=Chuck E. Cheese's (1991-2020)</h2>=
Fullerton, California opened its doors on December 17th, 1991, with a 3-Stage converted from a stage that originally came from Creative Engineering Inc.; in the Fullerton Town Center as the second store in Fullerton (It should not be confused with the Pizza Time Theatre that closed a few years before). In around the Mid 1990's, Fullerton would remodel [[Phase 1 (1994)|Phase 1]]. Fullerton remodeled to [[Phase 3 (2000)|Phase 3]] by 2003. In Spring 2007, Fullerton would remodel to the 2005 Remodel, removing the 3-Stage for a [[Studio C 2000|Studio C 2000, 16m]] and relocated the showroom towards the front of the store. Around this time, the store was infamous for an incident that occurred during Cheesevention 4 in 2007. The crew visited the Fullerton store in May 2007 to see their 3-Stage since it was one of the last 3-Stages in Califronia. However, they were disappointed when they arrived and the Studio C was already installed and the 3-Stage was long gone. The crew was kicked out by staff after filming and asking questions about the remodel which is the reason the store was infamous within the CEC community. The store would remain this way until they would close their doors for the final time on November 17th, 2020, due to COVID-19 Pandemic. 

<h2>=Post Closure (2020-)</h2>= 
After closure, Fullerton would remain vacant for a while until it was taken over by Five Below & a Localhost Internet Cafe, keeping the exterior intact but fully gutting the store's interior. The store's Gemini light was sent to the [Orlando (East), FL (449 N Alafaya Trail)]({{< ref "wiki/Orlando (East), FL (449 N Alafaya Trail).html" >}}) location on their [[Studio C (1997)|Studio C Alpha]], but it was removed in April 2023 during their 2.0 remodel. As of August 2023, Five Below & a Localhost Internet Cafe is still in the building.
