The in the, Early 2000's when they remodeled to remove the Balcony Seating & Showroom Walls. It is unknown if this location ever received the Cool Chuck outfit.

Snyder would remodel again to the CEC 2005 Remodel (2005 Remodel) in Mid 2011; involving the removal of the Dinner Lights, 90's Decorations, & added Purple Walls. Chuck's cap was removed in September 2012. Throughout the 2010's, the Snyder 2-Stage underwent numerous changes including the replacement of masks, & Chuck's outfit to Rockstar. The store would remain this way until June-July 2022 when Snyder received the 2.0 Remodel which involved the removal of the 2-Stage, moving the Dance Floor & Video Wall to face the back wall.
