<p><h2> History </h2></p>
<p>Phoenix (Bell) opened on March 26, 1999, with a Studio C (1997)|Studio C Alpha and the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Phase 2 (1997)" >}}">Phase 2</a> game package. However, there is not much information on this location in general, however. Around 2006/2007, they received the 2005 update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative, which involved removing all 90s decor for new decor, removing the showroom walls and balcony seating, added purple walls, and changed the exterior. Phoenix (Bell) remained like this until January 2015 (day unknown), when they closed permanently for unknown reasons. The building remained vacant for a few months until Dollar Tree opened on the space. As of July 2023, Dollar Tree is still on the space.</p>
