In Early 2005, Poughkeepsie underwent a minor remodel which which included the removal of some artwork, as well as the removal of showroom wall and balcony seating. By 2010, Chuck's outfit was replaced with the Avenger outfit, the exterior was remodeled for the second time the same year. By 2011, Chuck, Helen, and Jasper received new masks. Pasqually's mask was replaced a couple years later, as Mr. Munch's mask was the last original mask at the store. By the end of 2012, the dim lights were replaced with bright florescent lights.
