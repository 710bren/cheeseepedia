**_1895 South Rd, Store #505**_ is a Chuck E. Cheeseâ€™s location located in Poughkeepsie, New York; at The Shoppes at South Hills (Formerly South Hills Mall) shopping center. This location opened on December 6, 1993, and is still open to this day as a 2.0.

## History ##
Upon its opening, the location along with Hicksville was featured in a CEC Special Report segment, which was included in the showtape [Let The Good Times Roll]({{< ref "wiki/Let The Good Times Roll.md" >}}).

Poughkeepsie opened December 6th, 1993, in The Shoppes at South Hills (Formerly South Hills Mall), with a [1-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/1-Stage.md" >}}). By 2003, Chuck's Tux was replaced with the Cool Chuck outfit (Retraining the Derby). By 2004, Poughkeepsie underwent their first remodel which involved the exterior. In Early 2005, Poughkeepsie underwent a minor remodel which included the removal of some artwork, as well as the removal of showroom wall and balcony seating. By 2010, Chuck's outfit was replaced with the Avenger outfit, the exterior was remodeled for the second time the same year. By 2011, Chuck, Helen, and Jasper received new masks. Pasqually's mask was replaced a couple years later, as Mr. Munch's mask was the last original mask at the store. By the end of 2012, the dim lights were replaced with bright florescent lights. By 2013, Poughkeepsie removed their shelving, more 90s decor, and painted the walls purple. Later that year, Chuck's cap was removed. 

In October 2022, Poughkeepsie received the 2.0 Remodel which involved the removal of the 1-Stage for Dance Floor & Video Wall, remaining 90's decor, & repainting of the exterior for the 3rd time.

Poughkeepsie's Grand Reopening occurred sometime in November/December 2022.
