**_W.O.O.F. Radio**_ was an animatronic show produced by Creative Presentations for Celebration Station from 1982 to 1989, being used in several of the chain's locations up through 2001. 

Celebration Station's parent company, Whiteco, decided to officially end their relationship with Creative Presentations by 1990. Shortly thereafter, Sally Industries supplied the Daniel and the Dixie Diggers Trio + Jethro P. Hogg (_Daniel and the Dixie Diggers Trio + Jethro P. Hogg_) and The Rockin' Rascals (_The Rockin' Rascals_) animatronic shows for Celebration Station between 1991 and 1993.
