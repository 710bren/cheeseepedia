<p><h2> Stage </h2></p>
<p>Meriden's only stage was a Studio C 2000|Studio C Beta, 32m. Around 2009-2011, the curtains were disabled, and by 2011, Chuck received the Avenger shirt. The stage would remain like this until closure in 2013.</p>

<p><h2> History </h2></p>
<p>Meriden opened on January 30, 2002 with the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Phase 3 (2000)" >}}">Phase 3</a> remodel and a Studio C Beta. Unfortunately, not much is known about this location, other than a few videos that were taken throughout Meriden's history. Meriden was left untouched until May 19, 2013, when they would permanently close due to leasing issues. The building sat vacant for a short period until it was gutted and was split up between a GMC shop and PetSmart. As of July 2023, they are still there.</p>
