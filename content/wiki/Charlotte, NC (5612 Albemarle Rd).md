**_5612 Albemarle Rd**_ also known as 'Albemarle' is a Chuck E. Cheese that opened in November 1991 with a Road Stage which is still open to this day.
##History##
Charlotte (Albemarle) opened in November 1991 (day unknown) as one of two North Carolina locations with a Cyberamic Munch's Make Believe Band Stage (the other is [Durham, NC (3724 Mayfair St)]({{< ref "wiki/Durham, NC (3724 Mayfair St).md" >}}) which opened on March 7th, 1994 with a 1-Stage). This location opened with the 1988 Remodel with the CU decor, and the Road Stage. Around the mid-late 1990's, They replaced the logo with Coach Chuck and removed older 90's decor for newer decor and SkyTubes. In 2006-2007, they remodeled to the 2005 remodel which involved the removal of the showroom walls, removing older decor for newer decor, & adding purple walls. Currently, as of February 2023, the location still has the 2005 Remodel and the Road Stage.
##Stages##
Like all Road Stages at the time, Chuck wore his Tuxedo & Derby outfit. It is unknown if Charlotte (Albemarle) ever received the Cool Chuck outfit, although by the Late 2000's, Chuck's outfit was replaced with the Avenger outfit. After the 2000's and into the 2010's, Chuck was then given custom eyebrows and the Wink's eye was then broken and tilted.

As of February 2023, Charlotte (Albemarle) still has the Road Stage and 2005 Remodel.
