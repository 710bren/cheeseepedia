Family Album was a rare unused Caberet Test band that was temporally installed at 5 locations during Pizza Time Theatre's bankruptcy period due to a shortage of [Balcony Stage]({{< ref "wiki/Balcony Stage.md" >}}) animatronics. The show was available at select locations in Michigan, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts. The character's names were different at each location and were chosen through contests. The animatronics were made by Elnicky Enterprises, the same company responsible for the [Hot Fudge]({{< ref "wiki/Hot Fudge.md" >}}) animatronics that debuted around the same time. The Clawson, MI stage could rotate 360 degrees.
