<b><i>1036 Bloomington Rd</b></i> was a <i>Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre</i> that opened in 1984 with a {{- wiki-link "Cyberamics Balcony Stage" -}} and closed in December 1990 as a <i>ShowBiz Pizza</i> with {{- wiki-link "Chuck E's House Facade" -}}.
<h2> History </h2>
Champaign opened in 1984 with a {{- wiki-link "Cyberamics Balcony Stage" -}}. However, almost nothing is known about the store at all. The store would get the 1988 remodel and {{- wiki-link "Chuck E's House Facade" -}} in 1989, and rename the store to ShowBiz Pizza in progress. The store closed in December 1990 for unknown reasons. The store would become many businesses, but today, it remains a 'Bargain Bins' discount store.
The building itself still has some remains of when it used to be open- one of the colored checkers can still be seen on the wall under another layer of plaster, and the 'Now Showing' box remains to this day, although boarded up.
<h2> Stages and Animatronics </h2>
The {{- wiki-link "Cyberamics Balcony Stage" -}} was kept up until 1989, when they retrofitted it to {{- wiki-link "Chuck E's House Facade" -}}. The stage would only last a year, as they would close in December 1990.
