* Between all of the songs except for _Watch Me (Whip/Nae Nae)' the songs are mashed up between transitions. 
* The text crediting the artists,song name, and record label was forgotten for 'Daft Punk - 'One More Time' and at the beginning of 'Calvin Harris feat. Rihanna - 'This Is What You Came For'. 
* While Friday Night Neon never came back there were plans to bring it back in 2020 but due to Covid those plans were cancelled and most likely replaced with Chuck E. Cheese's Show 3 2020 & Mr. Munch's Glow Party (DJ Munch's Glow Party)
