## Trivia: ##
* The Play All You Can Play remix replaces Chuck's vocals with Helen's during his solo, and then replaces Munch's vocals with Helen's during his respective solo.
* The Dog Days of Summer remix removes the backing vocals (except for Helen, who also sings some of Jasper's lines).
* The Chuck E. Cheese's Birthday Song was re-recorded with all the backing vocals.
* Happy Birthday (Spanish) was re-recorded with the current US voice actors. 
* Song of Summer (Concert Remix) has Jessi sing Bella's lines and also ends the song with a fade-in of the characters saying their goodbyes.
