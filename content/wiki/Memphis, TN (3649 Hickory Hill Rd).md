Memphis (Hickory Hill) opened its doors on August 24th, 1982 with a Rock-afire Explosion show. It was originally a franchised-owned store. Like many other ShowBiz Pizza locations, it had a typical SPP layout seen in many other stores across the United States and would eventually receive the 1988 remodel years after it would open.

Memphis (Hickory Hill) remained this way until sometime in 2008-2009 when they received the 2005 Remodel which involved removing the Showroom Walls, balcony Seating, and received a new exterior and also removing some older 90's decor. Around 2014, they received the 2015 Remodel (Phase 5) which removed older Phase 4 decor and added newer decor. They would remain like this until their closure on October 27th 2020 due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. After their closure they would remain abandoned for a few months until in 2021 when a 'Crazy Hot Deals' moved in. Currently, as of February 2023, they still exist.
