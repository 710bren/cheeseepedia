<p><b><i>10 Wall St, Store #488</b></i> was a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Chuck E Cheese's" >}}">Chuck E. Cheese's</a> in Burlington, Massachusetts. The location opened August 4, 1992, and closed July 16, 2017. The store was located in an unnamed plaza.</p>
<p><h2> History </h2></p>
<p>Burlington opened in an unnamed plaza on August 4th, 1992; two weeks before <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Worcester, MA (50 Southwest Cutoff)" >}}">Worcester</a>. This was the second 2-Stage installed in the New England region and first in Massachusetts. Unlike many of them at the time, this location had Jasper's banjo, like Worcester.</p>
<p>In 1994/1995, They received a remodel and got the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Phase 1 (1994)" >}}">Phase 1</a> game package, adding the Thumb Chuck exterior they had until closing.</p>
<p>In November 2001, Burlington added a Toddler Zone. Then they got rid of the Ball Crawl sometime in 2002. In the summer of the same year, Chuck's Tuxedo & Derby was replaced with the Cool Chuck outfit.</p>
<p>In 2004, they replaced the former side curtains with lift curtains.</p>
<p>In late 2008, Burlington received the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/CEC 2005 Remodel Program" >}}">CEC 2005 Remodel</a> which removed the showroom wall(s), the balcony seating, painted several walls purple, replaced the dim lighting with brighter florescent supermarket lighting, and replaced the record/album parody posters with posters of kids smiling. The exterior was left intact due to the plaza owners being strict.</p>
<p>In early 2012, The curtains were removed, Helen got a new mask and wig, and they received 2 new Flat Screen TVs hanging from the ceiling.</p>
<p>In early 2013, the Cool Chuck shorts were replaced with the Avenger shorts. Chuck's cap was then removed in September of the same year.</p>
<p>In late 2015-early 2016, the original screen between Chuck E and Helen was replaced with a modern flat screen; then they received the Play Pass later that year.</p>
<p>On June 26th, 2017, the store announced that they would close due to leasing issues.</p>
<p>Finally on July 16th, 2017, Burlington was permanently closed. As of 2024, it's now X Golf center.</p>
