The 1978 Helen Henny Name Sign made the only appearance at the second  where it took the role of identifying the Helen Henny animatronic.

## Production ##
Not much is known about the production of this nameplate, although we can assume it was produced between February to November 1978. 

## Usage ##
The only usage of the 1978 Helen Henny nameplate was at the second Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre on 1371 Kooser Road in San Jose, placed under the Helen Henny animatronic from December 1978 to May 1980. 

## Design ##
Following the design of all the other Kooser nameplates of the time period, Helen Hennys nameplate used a rounded black base with the yellow text 'HELEN HENNY' which was enclosed in a thin border of the same color placed on the base of the nameplate. 

## Gallery ##
TBD
