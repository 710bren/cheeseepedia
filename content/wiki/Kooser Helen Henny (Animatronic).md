After Kooser upgraded to the Balcony show, Helen's whereabouts were unknown. It's assumed she was moved to [Sunnyvale]({{< ref "wiki/Pizza Time Theatre Sunnyvale, CA Corporate Office.md" >}}), but unlike Kooser Chuck E. Cheese (Animatronic) (Chuck E), there are no pictures of her at Sunnyvale. She is currently presumed to have been destroyed when Sunnyvale relocated to [Texas]({{< ref "wiki/Showbiz Pizza Time Corporate Office.md" >}}) after PTT's bankruptcy.
