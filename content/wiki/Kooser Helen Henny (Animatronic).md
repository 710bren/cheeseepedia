**_Kooser Helen Henny**_ was a Guest Star animatronic featured at the [San Jose, CA (1371 Kooser Rd)]({{< ref "wiki/San Jose, CA (1371 Kooser Rd).md" >}}) Pizza Time Theatre. She was alternated with other guest stars until 1980, when Kooser would upgrade to the [Balcony Show]({{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage.md" >}})

## History ##
After Kooser upgraded to the Balcony show, Helen's whereabouts were unknown. It's assumed she was moved to [Sunnyvale]({{< ref "wiki/Pizza Time Theatre Sunnyvale, CA Corporate Office.md" >}}), but unlike Kooser Chuck E. Cheese (Animatronic) (Chuck E), there are no pictures of her at Sunnyvale. She is currently presumed to have been destroyed when Sunnyvale relocated to [Texas]({{< ref "wiki/Showbiz Pizza Time Corporate Office.md" >}}) after PTT's bankruptcy.

## Design ##
Kooser Helen is an upgraded version of [Winchester Helen Henny]({{< ref "wiki/Winchester Helen Henny (Animatronic).md" >}}). She has long brown hair, brown eyes, and wears a black necklace with a gold and black medallion. She wears a white shirt with a purple vest. She carries a guitar and has yellow hands with red painted talons/fingernails.
