The Flag Wavers were prop animatronics installed in Pizza Time Theatre locations throughout the 1980s, generally found on the Cyberamics Portrait / Shelf Stage (Portrait / Shelf Stage) and [Balcony Stage.]({{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage.md" >}}) Throughout the 1980s, they would be largely produced by Riordan Co., who would also manufacture Jasper T. Jowls (Cyberamic) (Jasper)'s banjo, and a later version of Artie Antlers' antlers. They would occasionally be found around the Chuck E.'s House (Rocker Stage), Chuck E.'s House Facade (C-Stage) and on a couple [2-]({{< ref "wiki/San Antonio, TX (8220 Windsor Cross).md" >}})[Stages]({{< ref "wiki/Anchorage, AK (308 E Northern Lights Blvd).md" >}}), too, as leftovers from the previously stated stages. The last location to have flags was the [Simi Valley, CA (71 Tierra Rejada Rd)]({{< ref "wiki/Simi Valley, CA (71 Tierra Rejada Rd).md" >}}) location, which closed in May 2008.
