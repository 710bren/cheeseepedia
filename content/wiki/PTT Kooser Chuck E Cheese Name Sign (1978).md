The **_1978 Chuck E. Cheese nameplate**_ was first used at the second Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre located on [\2](\1) where it was placed under the [\2](\1) for the purpose of identifying it, a practice seen in the previous store on [\2](\1)

##  Production ## 
Although we do not have a specific date, we can theorize it was produced between January 1978 to November 1978, where it was most likely the first nameplate produced in the batch due to the significance of the character. 

##  Usage ## 
The only usage of the sign was at the 1371 Kooser Road location located in San Jose, where it was used from December 1978 to May 1980 under the Kooser Chuck E. Cheese animatronic, where it was presumably shipped to corporate alongside the Kooser Chuck E. Cheese animatronic in 1980 or was set in one of many storage rooms inside the massive 20,000 square foot location. 

##  Design ## 
Pizza Time Theatre Incorporated most likely wanted the nameplate uniform to what they had at their 370 South Winchester Boulevard location, although more rectangular and changing out the white colored areas to a more yellow color. Chuck E. Cheese's nameplate followed a black and yellow color scheme, with the text 'CHUCK E. CHEESE' placed on top of the base and enclosed in a thin border of the same color. This time lacking 'ATARI 1977' below the text as Winchester had, due to them forming into their own corporation earlier that year.
