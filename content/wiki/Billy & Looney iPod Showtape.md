The **_Billy & Looney Showtape**_ was a showtape created in 2006 for what Creative Engineering called the _Chris Thrash Controller,_ which is an iPod based controller to play shows for a [Billy Bob]({{< ref "wiki/Billy Bob.md" >}}) and [Looney Bird]({{< ref "wiki/Looney Bird.md" >}}) animatronic. <ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9phDrePjCA</ref>

## Production ##

### DBX Decodes ###
While most songs were DBX decoded due to the controller's lack of a need for a DBX box, some had this step accidentally skipped, and sound worse as a result. Due to both channels being merged to fit the showtape format, alongside peaks in the audio, attempts to decode the songs as they are won't be as fruitful.
