<b><i>3760 Ming Ave, Store #41</b></i> is a Showbiz Pizza/Chuck E. Cheese located in Bakersfield, California.

This location opened as a ShowBiz Pizza Place on November 16, 1982, and is still open today with the 2.0 remodel and Dance Floor.

<h2>History</h2>

<h2>=ShowBiz</h2>=
Bakersfield opened as ShowBiz Pizza Place on November 16, 1982 with the RockAfire Explosion like every other Showbiz Pizza location. This was the 2nd Showbiz Pizza store to open in California (2nd to open in the state after [[Dublin, CA (7590 Amador Valley Blvd)|Dublin]]). It was then sold to corporate on October 27th, 1986 along with [[Oceanside, CA (2481 Vista Way)|Oceanside]], [[Fresno, CA (3117 W Shaw Ave)|Fresno]], [[Visalia, CA (4345 W Noble Ave)|Visalia]] and [[Escondido, CA (624 W Mission Ave)|Escondido]]. 

Sadly, there's no documentation of Bakersfield when it was a Showbiz Pizza.

<h2>=Tux Chuck and Cool Chuck Eras </h2>=
Sometime in 1991-1992, Bakersfield underwent Concept Unification, and The Rock-afire was replaced by Munch's Make Believe Band, complete with all of the characters including extras such as Building, Moon, Wink, Pizzacam, and Munch Jr. Chuck E. wore his signature black tuxedo and red derby hat. Bakersfield then remodeled to [[Phase 1 (1994)|Phase 1]] in around 1994-1995. In 1998, Bakersfield underwent another remodel which involved the 3-Stage being removed and replaced with a Studio C Alpha which relocated the show from the left side wall to the back wall. This also included the removal of parts of the former Showroom Walls for new ones, original Balcony Seating & some other changes as well.  

Sadly, there's no documentation of when Bakersfield had the 3-Stage.

<h2>=Avenger Era</h2>=
Sometime around 2006-2007, Bakersfield remodeled to  the 2005 update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative, removing the Showroom Walls, Balcony Seating, and a new exterior. It is unknown of Bakersfield ever had the Cool Chuck outfit.

It's Unknown when Bakersfield got the Avenger outfit. Chuck's cap was removed in 2013.

<h2>=Present Day</h2>=
In around 2014-2016, The Interactive Console was removed. The Projector was also removed for a Flat screen TV around this time as well.

In June 2019, Bakersfield started remodeling to 2.0, which involved the removal of the Studio C Alpha for a Dance Floor; this also included the removal of the Toddler Zone & [Skytubes]({{< ref "wiki/Skytubes.html" >}}). The store had it's grand reopening on August 1, 2019. Currently, as of February 2023, they still have the 2.0 remodel and the Dance Floor.

<h2>Stages</h2>
Originally, Bakersfield featured a Rock-Afire Explosion, as all other Showbiz locations did, in around 1991, they would undergo Concept Unification, turning the RAE into the 3-Stage, they would have the 3-Stage until 1998, when they would receive one of the first Studio Cs in California (Which was a Studio C Alpha). They would have that until June 2019, when it was removed for a 2019 model Dance Floor. As of February 2023, Bakersfield still has the Dance Floor.
