**_4027 W Mercury Blvd**_ was a _Pizza Time Theatre/Chuck E. Cheese_ that opened on May 1982 (day unknown) as a corporate _Pizza Time Theatre_ with a Balcony Stage Show and closed in May 2002 with the 2-Stage.

It was located in the Hampton Plaza Shopping Center.

This store relocated to [Hampton, VA (5 Towne Centre Way)]({{< ref "wiki/Hampton, VA (5 Towne Centre Way).md" >}}) which is still open to this day.
##History##
Hampton opened its doors in May 1982 with a Balcony Stage. It was originally a corporate-owned Pizza Time Theatre location. In the Late 80's, Hampton would receive the 1988 remodel and removed older decor for newer decor, an exterior change, and the removal of the Balcony Stage for Chuck E.'s House Facade. In the Early 90's, Hampton would receive a minor remodel, this time another change to the exterior, more old decor removed for newer ones, and Chuck E.'s House Facade being removed for the 2-Stage. In the Late 90's, they would receive yet another remodel, which changed the exterior again, and added SkyTubes. Hampton remained like this until 2002 when they relocated. After they relocated, Hampton was abandoned for a year or two until they became a clothing store named Citi Trends. The exterior sign was changed in 2016. Currently, as of February 2023, the location is still the Citi Trends with the Chuck E. Cheese's labels intact although very hard to see due to old age. 
##Stages##
When Hampton opened, it housed a Balcony Stage like the other Pizza Time Theatres that opened at the time. Unfortunately, there are hardly any videos and no exterior photos to exist of Hampton. Sometime between the Late 80's, they installed Chuck E.â€™s House Facade, otherwise known as the [https://chuckepedia.com/wiki/Chuck_E.'s_House_Facade C-Stage]. This location would get a 2-Stage installed in the early 90's.

In May 2002, Hampton relocated to their current location which destroyed their 2-Stage.
