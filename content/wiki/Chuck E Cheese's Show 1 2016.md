## Trivia: ##

* This was the first show without the Department 18 logo on the DVD Cover. 
* 'Giant Armadillo Named Phil' is originally from Show 2 2015 and 'Most Epic Mouse' is originally from Show 5 2015
* Most Epic Mouse is now programmed for the US stores. 
* The Solo Child birthday was only used for most of 2016 until being removed from the lineup due to unknown reasons but it can be guessed it's most likely being it was useless to have.
* Chuck E.'s Happy Dance was a brand new live show featuring a brand new countdown featuring 'Raoul the Owl'. Live show filmed at Plano, Tx.
* The  'Rip It, Win It' intermission was the first version of the 'Rip It, Win It' promotion. The prizes for 2016 were 'Tokens, Tickets, V.I.P Trip to Great Wolf Lodge, or a brand new car from AutoNation'
* The 'Timecode' addition for this show is a low quality behind the scenes clip of the Nigel shot from 'Let's have a Party'
