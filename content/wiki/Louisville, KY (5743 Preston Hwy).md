**_5743 Preston Hwy**_ was a Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre/Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza that opened in July 1982 with a [Cyberamics Balcony Stage]({{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage.md" >}}) and closed in November 1997 with a [Chuck E.'s House Facade]({{< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House Facade.md" >}}) stage. It was located in/across from an unnamed shopping center. This was the first location in Louisville, and one of the first in Kentucky overall.

## History ##
### PTT Era (July 1982-Late 1980s) ###
In July 1982, a new Chuck E. Cheese opened in Louisville with a [Cyberamics Balcony Stage]({{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage.md" >}}) and many features. No pictures have surfaced of this era, so there is very little information on what they had, but it's likely they had many things, such as wood panels, signage, arcade games, food, and the stage. They also had The King as the lounge act.

When [Louisville, KY (5000 Shelbyville Rd)]({{< ref "wiki/Louisville, KY (5000 Shelbyville Rd).md" >}}) opened in 1984, this store lost many customers, as the newer store was more popular with families, as opposed to the older store. This store was also one of the few to survive the 1984 bankruptcy closures. They would keep the same features until the late 1980s, when they would remodel for the first and final time.
### CEC Era (Late 1980s-November 1997) ###
In the late 1980s, this store would remodel to the 1986 SPT Remodel Program. This would change many old features, such as signage, exterior, and carpeting/decor. The biggest changes would be the addition of new posters and signage inside and outside, the addition of wood paneling, and the biggest change, the removal of the [Cyberamics Balcony Stage]({{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage.md" >}}) for the [Chuck E.'s House Facade]({{< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House Facade.md" >}}) stage, which would change many features of the showroom. The store would keep this remodel until they closed. They would also keep The King, which they would eventually remove at an unknown date. This store would uniquely also never install blue and white awnings above the counters.

In the mid-late 1990s, the store would go through some extra minor changes, such as Helen's cosmetics being updated, and The King's supposed removal. These were the final changes to the store ever done, as they would close later on.

In November 1997, this store did it's final day, and closed permanently. It is unknown why exactly the store closed, but guesses include lease, lack of customers or money, or more. The store would be vacated shortly after, with pieces being dismantled and sent to other stores.
### Post-CEC Era (November 1997-Present?) ###
After the store closed, the building was left vacant until businesses took the space over, where definitively the old store was located remains a mystery, but it is most likely that the space was split and filled by Hollywood Video and Verizon Wireless. After Hollywood Video closed in 2010, it would be made into Hibbett Sports, which is likely where the old Chuck E. Cheese's was located. If it was, all traces are long gone.
## Stages ##
When this store opened, they would have a [Cyberamics Balcony Stage]({{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage.md" >}}), which would in turn be replaced with [Chuck E.'s House Facade]({{< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House Facade.md" >}}).
