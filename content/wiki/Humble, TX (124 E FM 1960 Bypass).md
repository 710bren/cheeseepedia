## History ##

### Pre-CEC ###
This location has originally opened as a Discovery Zone. Not that much information is known about Humble's Discovery Zone, but closed presumably around the 90s.

### Phase 3 ###
On December 16th, 1999, this store had opened their doors with a Phase 3 and Studio C Alpha stage. There aren't any known photos of this location as a Phase 3.

### Phase 4 ###
Between November 2007 to February 2008, Humble had remodeled to Phase 4. The exterior would remain completely phase 4 until near the end of 2021, when the exterior was repainted due to the shopping center it was in remodeling. It would remain like this until 2022 when they received the 2.0 remodel.

### 2021 Shooting ###
On December 31st, 2021, a 24-year-old Corpus Christi native, Calogero Duenes was shot outside of this location while bringing his daughter's birthday cake to the inside of this store. The shooter, Antoine Daniel Badon was in his car when he shot the father and took off. The shooter was eventually arrested and charged.

### 2.0 Remodel ###
Between April to May 2022, Humble had started their 2.0 remodel, and their Studio C Alpha was removed around May 2022 to be replaced with a Dance Floor. Apart of the remodel included a special mural near the showroom, staring Chuck E. and his band, including Bella B.
