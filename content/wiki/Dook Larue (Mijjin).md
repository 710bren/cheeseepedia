<h2> Design </h2>
This bot is a standard Mijjin mech, the mech has brown eye pieces. The bot is the Dook Larue Character from the [Rock-Afire Explosion]({{< ref "wiki/Rock-afire Explosion.md" >}}) in the smaller Mijjin style, sporting a brand new outfit, consisting of Beige Boots, Purple Overalls, a Green Shirt, and a hat with the colors Pink, Blue, and Purple.

The only cosmetic differences between bots are different fabric patches on the Overalls.
