The articulated Pasqually walkaround head was created in 1996 by a former CEI employee, Billy Bob Irving. This head was used in three different showtapes, those being:

* August 1996
* April 1997
* August 1997

During these showtapes, the head was often seen paired with Pasqually’s standard 90’s outfit.

In addition, the head was the only one to not be used in the notorious CEC movie, _Chuck E. Cheese In The Galaxy 5000_.<ref> https://youtu.be/LvPDKzSaeyg</ref Instead, a live actor dressed up in Pasqually’s outfit is used for the role.

The head was destroyed by corporate between the 2000s-2015.
