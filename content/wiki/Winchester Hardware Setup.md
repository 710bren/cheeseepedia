The <b><i>Pizza Time Theatre Winchester Hardware Setup</b></i> was the system used to program the animatronics exclusively at the [San Jose, CA (370 S Winchester Blvd)]({{< ref "wiki/San Jose, CA (370 S Winchester Blvd).md" >}}) from May 1977 to sometime between 1980 and 1981.

The system was developed by the Cyan Engineering subdivision of Atari (also known as the <i>Grass Valley Team</i>), headed by Larry Emmons and Gary Waters<ref>https://archive.org/details/atariincbusiness0000gold/page/328/mode/2up?q=theatre</ref>

<h2> Hardware </h2>

<h2>= PDP-11/70 </h2>=
The main programming computer would be the <i>PDP-11/70,</i> running the Winchester Programmer software for generating programming data. It is unclear if any terminal was used to program the characters, or to make the software itself.

<h2>= TEAC 4-Track Tape Deck </h2>=
An unnamed TEAC 4-Track tape deck would be used to record audio and programming signals. The Winchester 4-Track Reel would be the format used for data, where audio, programming signals, and a timecode track would be streamed in real time.

Due to the later [SongCode Hardware Setup]({{< ref "wiki/SongCode Hardware Setup.md" >}}) using a TEAC A-2340 Tape Deck, which seemingly recorded only in the <i>2-track stereo-mode,</i> it is a possibility that this was a carryover from the Winchester store, giving this unnamed tape deck a likely model.

<h2> Live Playback </h2>
It is unclear how the system, if at all, connected to the [Winchester Control System]({{< ref "wiki/Winchester Control System.md" >}}) for controlling the animatronics. Multiple statements about the programming of the Winchester system vaguely imply that all programming was done in a separate room, blind to visual feedback or any sort of live playback system. Statements about the process being <b>trial and error</b> and having to <b>program to the Teac tape player and run through until everything was synchronized</b><ref>https://archive.org/details/atariincbusiness0000gold/page/328/mode/2up?q=theatre</ref> gives rise to the possibility of it being the only programming system out of the company's history that didn't have access to visual programming.
