**8039 North 35th Ave** was a Showbiz Pizza Place that opened on October 28, 1983 with a Rock-Afire Explosion, which is still open to this day.

This location received Concept Unification in November 1990, and as of October 2022, they are the oldest operating 3-Stage.

## History ##
Phoenix was the first Showbiz Pizza Place opened in the state of Arizona, opening on October 28, 1983. There were a total of 3 Showbiz locations opened in Arizona, which included Phoenix, Yuma (which closed between 1984 and 1986), and West Mesa (which closed in 2015 with a Studio C Alpha). Phoenix would originally feature the Rock-Afire Explosion from when they opened until November of 1990, when they would convert to a 3-Stage, they were the 5th 3-Stage installed. They would remodel to the 1993 Remodel sometime in the mid 90's (possibly around the time they got CU), They would have it for a bit, then they would remodel to the 2005 Remodel in the 2000's, which they still have to this day.

## Stages ##
Originally when the store opened, they had a Rock-Afire Explosion, as all other Showbiz's had. They would have the RAE for a bit until November of 1990, when they would undergo Concept Unification, they were actually the 5th Showbiz to undergo CU, which involved turning the RAE into the Chuck E. Cheese characters. The showtape they first played, other than the CU Premiere, was the CEC September 1990 Show. As of October 2022, they still have the 3-Stage, with it currently being the oldest 3-Stage, as all the ones before it either closed or replaced it with another stage. Their 3-Stage has many different things than all other 3-Stages, with the buildings being different, as well as the 'Pasqually's Amateur Hour' brick wall being different. The stage is in decent condition, with Chuck E. wearing the Rockstar shirt and Cool Chuck shorts, and Pasqually wearing Jasper shoes, Jasper formerly wore Pasqually's shoes, but were switched sometime in the late 2010's. Jasper also originally had Billy Bob's guitar, but now uses the Flying Cheese guitar. The Building, Moon, Munch Jr., and Pizzacam animatronics were removed between the 90's and 2000's, leaving the Wink to be the only character other than the main 5 to be left. The Wink currently has the 'In Pizza We Trust' phrase uncovered, which is one of the last that still has it uncovered.
