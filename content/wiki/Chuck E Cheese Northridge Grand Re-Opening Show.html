<h2> Trivia </h2>

* This would be the first showtape to have curtains officially programmed since the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/September 2005 Show" >}}">September 2005 Show</a>.
* At 7:50pm a countdown would start reading 'Show Starts In' with a 10 minute countdown. Once finished playing, Together We've Got It 2017 would play.
* According to Logan Carreiro (Chief Animatronics Officer), before the event officially began, Segment 1 from the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/SPP Concept Unification Premiere" >}}">SPP Concept Unification Premiere</a> played on the stage. This is most likely false as this would require custom programming to make work.
