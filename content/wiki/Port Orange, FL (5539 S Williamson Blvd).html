<p><b><i>5539 S Williamson Blvd</b></i> was a Chuck E. Cheese's that opened on December 26, 2013, and closed on September 29, 2022, with a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Circles of Light" >}}">Circles of Light</a>. A new location scheduled to be built on the site of the former location will reopen in late 2024 with the 2.0 remodel.</p>
<p><h2>Stages</h2></p>
<p>When the store opened, they had a Circles of Light, 32M, the animatronic came from the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Dallas, TX (13364 Montfort Dr)" >}}">Dallas, Texas Montfort Dr</a> location; which was originally removed in September 2012. The robot had 16M legs and therefore no foot tap movement when it was installed in Port Orange.</p>
<p><h2> History</h2></p>
<p>A Chuck E. Cheese's restaurant had not existed in Volusia County, the Daytona Beach metro area, since the Daytona Beach Pizza Time Theatre closed in 1983. When considering a new unit in the area, CEC Entertainment executives reviewed studies that claimed that the City of Port Orange was the fastest developing suburbia in Florida. Regardless of the much more sizeable population in Daytona Beach, CEC Entertainment elected to build a unit in Port Orange.</p>
<p>This location opened on December 26, 2013. An early Phase 5 store, it received Rockstar-era art but lots of Avenger-era regulatory signage, previously used equipment, and games.</p>
<p>The store was originally planned to open without an animatronic, but CEC Entertainment executives decided that it should have one given its proximity to Orlando and Disney World.</p>
<p>The store was located in the newly developed Port Orange Pavilion shopping center. Behind the Chuck E. Cheese's property is a playground and fountain area.</p>
<p>Port Orange was severely damaged from the effects of Hurricane Ian. The ceiling of the location caved in and the exterior started to collapse. In addition, the interior had sustained extreme water damage. The location was considered unsalvageable and was permanently closed and demolished in October of 2022.</p>
<p>The location is being rebuilt and is projected to reopen in late 2024 on the existing property with the 2.0 remodel.</p>
