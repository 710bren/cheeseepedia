The articulated Jasper walkaround head was created in 1996 by a former CEI employee, Billy Bob Irving. This head was used in three different showtapes, those being:

* August 1996
* April 1997
* August 1997

During these showtapes, the head was often seen paired with Jasper’s standard 90’s outfit. 

In addition, the head was used in the notorious CEC movie, _Chuck E. Cheese In The Galaxy 5000_.<ref> https://youtu.be/LvPDKzSaeyg</ref> During the movie, the head is seen paired with his standard outfit.

The head was destroyed by corporate between the 2000s-2015.
