##  History ## 
Newark opened on August 5, 1997 with the [\2](\1) remodel and a [[1-Stage]], one of the last ever installed. Unfortunately, not much information is known about Newark from around this time.

In 2007/2008, Newark received the 2005 update to the [[CEC 2005 Remodel Program]], which removed all 90s decor, removed showroom walls and balcony seating, replaced the lighting, and received a complete exterior remodel. During the 2005 remodel era, the store was featured on numerous stock images of CEC.

In the later months of 2018, Newark would begin the 2.0 remodel, removing the [\2](\1) and [[Video Wall]]. The remodel would also cause the removal of the dome that was on top of the building from opening in 1997. As of October 2023, Newark still has the 2.0 remodel.
