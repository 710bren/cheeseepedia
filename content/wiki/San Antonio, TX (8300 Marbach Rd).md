## History ##
Marbach, San Antonio opened in 1983 (month and day unknown) with a Balcony Stage. Unfortunately, there is basically no documentation on this store at all, other than a few advertisements. The location closed in February 1984 (day unknown) for unknown reasons, but it may be underperforming or competition from other San Antonio stores. It was later passed on to many businesses, and as of today, it is now El Bucanero, a Mexican restaurant.
