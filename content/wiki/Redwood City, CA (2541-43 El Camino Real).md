##  History ## 
Redwood City opened on December 28, 1999 on top of a Discovery Zone. Just like other stores opening at around the time, it originally had [\2](\1), which included late 90s decor, [\2](\1) stage. It later received [\2](\1), like other stores. In the late 2000s, this location received (interior only) the 2005 update to the [[2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative]], which involved removing some 90s decor for new decor, tearing down the showroom walls, added purple walls, and threw out older games for newer games and rides. By the late 2010s, the Skytubes were removed for more rides. As of July 2023, Redwood City remains like this.
