**2030 S Hurstborne Pwky** is a Chuck E. Cheese's that opened on January 2, 2000 with a [Studio C Alpha]({{< ref "wiki/Studio C Alpha.md" >}}), which is still open to this day.

They are the 3rd location in Louisville, after the Preston Highway and Shelbyville Road locations which both closed in the 1990's.As of September 2022, Louisville is the last animatronic stage in Kentucky, after [Bowling Green]({{< ref "wiki/Bowling Green, KY (2625 Scottsville Rd).md" >}}) removed their [Studio C Cappa]({{< ref "wiki/Studio C Cappa.md" >}}) because of their 2.0 remodel in July 2022.

## History ##
The City of Louisville had 2 Pizza Time Theatres in the 1980's, located on 5743 Preston Hwy, which opened in July 1982 and closed in November 1997, and 5000 Shelbyville Rd, which opened between February and March of 1984 and closed in December 1991. After 2 years, a new Chuck E. Cheese's opened on 2030 S Hurstborne Pwky, with a [Studio C Alpha]({{< ref "wiki/Studio C Alpha.md" >}}) stage, being the first Studio C stage in Kentucky, and the only Alpha in the State.

## Stages ##
The store originally opened with a [Studio C Alpha]({{< ref "wiki/Studio C Alpha.md" >}}), being the first Studio C stage in the state, and the only Alpha in the state. As of September 2022, they still have the Alpha, with it also being the last animatronic stage in Kentucky, after the [Bowling Green]({{< ref "wiki/Bowling Green, KY (2625 Scottsville Rd).md" >}}) location removed their [Studio C Cappa]({{< ref "wiki/Studio C Cappa.md" >}}) in July of 2022.
