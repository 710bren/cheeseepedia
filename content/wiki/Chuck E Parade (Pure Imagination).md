##  Summary ## 
We start with Mr. Munch telling the audience that Chuck E. Cheese will be preforming soon! Then Jasper makes a joke about why they don't get down and perform with the kids in which Helen says its easier to see up there. Pasqually then reminds the audience that Chuck E. Cheese will be out very soon. They then sing a parody of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willy_Wonka_%26_the_Chocolate_Factory 'Pure Imagination' (From 'Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory' Soundtrack)]. After this Chuck appears and starts singing and performing to a parody of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hey,_Look_Me_Over_(song) Hey Look Me Over]. During this parody Munch's Make Believe Band sing about the many wonderful ways your 'Pure Imagination' can be used. They then wonder where they should go first with their imagination ending with a jungle. They then arrive in the jungle and begin exploring whilst singing a song about exploring and looking for animals on their 'Jungle Parade'. They say the only way to be safe in the jungle is to 'Look high, look low. Look all around. Listen! and you'll hear lots of Junglely sounds' They then pretended their elephant trunks then saying 'Look high, look low. Look all around. Listen! and you'll hear lots of Junglely sounds' They then act like Monkey's swinging from a vine Look high, look low again. They then hear frogs and eventually get through the swamp. Eventually they go into a cave where a lion is found after that they run out of the cave while again singing the song they started with but fast then sing the 'Look high, look low. Look all around. Listen! and you'll hear lots of Junglely sounds' again. After this they then sing a modified version [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_the_Hop Danny and the Juniors- At The Hop]. After this the show is over with Chuck & Munch's Make Believe Band give their goodbyes with the instrumental of the CEC version of 'Pure Imagination' slowly fading out. with the short wink sound effect ending it.
