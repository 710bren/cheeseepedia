##Design##
The design features Avenger Chuck E. Cheese in his complete outfit, shaped in the Funko POP! style. Chuck E. is in a neutral standing pose, with his right arm outstretched to the side, and his left arm holding a Type 4 design token, which began production in 1995 with the CEC Token 401 (B, C, N). The token is modified to have its date at the bottom blanked out and replaced with another stamped dot. Chuck E.'s cap is also facing forward instead of flipped around, a trait generally only shared with the [Chuck 2005]({{< ref "wiki/Chuck 2005 (Costume Head).md" >}}) and [Chuck 2010 Costume Head]({{< ref "wiki/Chuck 2010 (Costume Head).md" >}}).
