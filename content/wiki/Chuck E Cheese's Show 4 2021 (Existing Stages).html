<h2> Trivia </h2>
The Day & Night system created for the show was a result of the CEC Marketing Team. The way the system works is different for the two main types Existing and Studio C. For Existing stages the Day & Night DVDs were separate while for Studio C based systems would automatically switch from Day to Night at 6pm.
