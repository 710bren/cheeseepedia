The <b><i>Circus Tape</b></i> is a semi-lost [Rock-afire Explosion]({{< ref "wiki/Rock-afire Explosion.md" >}}) showtape from 1985 for [ShowBiz Pizza Place]({{< ref "wiki/ShowBiz Pizza Place.md" >}}).<ref name=':0' />

<h2> History </h2>
The first hint of the showtape existing would come from the uncovering of the 1986 SPP Circus - Monkees tape in 2008, which at the time was believed to be the originator of the songs.<ref>https:<i>web.archive.org/web/20081219234700/http:</i>www.showbizpizza.com/review/rae/index.html</ref> On October 21, 2011, the first sightings of the tape would be posted online, though once again presumed to be the Circus/Monkees collaboration tape.<ref>https:<i>web.archive.org/web/20190925034644/https:</i>tokensonly.com/2011/10/21/road-trip-to-arcade-nirvana-2010-part-3/</ref>

On May 25th, 2024, Creative Engineering would release a YouTube video with a segment detailing the Circus showtape- as it was unclear to Aaron that the tape had been lost since it's creation. The <i><nowiki/>'The Show Must Go On</i>' segment would be partially debut, with plans for a release of the tape teased.<ref name=':0' />

On July 14, 2024, at Billy Con IV at [Billy Bob's Wonderland]({{< ref "wiki/Billy Bob's Wonderland.md" >}}), the segment <i>Tears of a Clown</i> from the tape would debut after being found by a fan, Jonah/Rockafirefan123.<ref>https://youtu.be/SCzbQrM4Gx0</ref>

<h2> Show List </h2>
It is unknown the order of the segments, nor are all of the segments currently known. It is highly likely the segment <i>Curly Shuffle</i> from the later SPP Circus - Monkees compilation tape was also from this tape, but it does not have any introduction to confirm.
