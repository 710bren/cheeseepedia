<b><i>2515 Viking Dr</b></i> is a Chuck E. Cheese's that opened in May 2013 (day unknown) and is still open today with a Circles of Light, 16M.

This was the relocation of [Bossier City, LA (2001 Airline Dr)]({{< ref "wiki/Bossier City, LA (2001 Airline Dr).md" >}}), which opened on November 23, 1992 and closed in May 2013 (day unknown) with a 2-Stage.

<h2> Stages </h2>
Bossier City opened with a Circles of Light, 16M. It was one of many COLs which featured a animatronic. On September 19, 2022, the bot ceased programming. As of August 2024, Bossier City remains like that with the addition of the dance floor.

<h2> History </h2>
Bossier City opened in May 2013 (day unknown) as the relocation of the [old location]({{< ref "wiki/Bossier City, LA (2001 Airline Dr).md" >}}), which closed around the same time. It currently has the 2013 update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative, which included early Rockstar decor and the COL stage. Not much changed to this location throughout the years, and Bossier City is still in operation to this very day.

Bossier City opened before the 2013 remodel was finalized, which is why a lot of older 1998-2010 wall decor is present at the store. Bossier City does have three sets of Rockstar Chuck wall art at the entrance though. Between 2022 and 2023, the COL animatronic was removed from the stage mostly likely due to it no longer being programmed for shows. Because of this, Bossier City now has a Circles of Light without the bot. In 2024, They received the 2.0 refresh with the Dance Floor, keeping COL stage.
