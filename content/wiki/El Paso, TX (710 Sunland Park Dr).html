<p><b><i>710 Sunland Park Dr</b></i> is a Chuck E. Cheese location located in El Paso, TX.</p>
<p>The store opened on February 21, 1994, with a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/1-Stage" >}}">1-Stage</a>. El Paso, also known as Sunland Park or Sunland would open up with the second-to-last Mini Unit variant of the 1-Stage. It was also one of the last stores to still have the original 90s rainbow checker pattern on the exterior. It is not to be confused with the other four El Paso stores, such as the two closed Pizza Time Theatres on El Paso, TX (9348 Dyer St)|Dyer St or El Paso, TX (1166 Yarbrough Dr)|Yarbrough Dr, which opened with the Balcony stage, or the other Chuck E. Cheese's on El Paso, TX (9801 Gateway Blvd)|Gateway Blvd which opened with a Studio C Alpha, and on El Paso, TX (1910 N Zaragoza Rd)|N Zaragoza Rd, which opened with a botless Circles of Light.</p>
<p>El Paso (Sunland Park) would have their 1-Stage show removed in April 2024 in favor of a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Chuck E Live Stage (Dance Floor)" >}}">Chuck E. Live Stage (Dance Floor)</a> and <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Video Wall" >}}">Video Wall</a>.</p>
<p><h2> History </h2></p>
<p>Sunland Park opened on February 21, 1994, as the third location in El Paso, and the first and only to get a 1-Stage. They would get the second-to-last Mini Unit variant of the stage. This type of 1-Stage would only be installed <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Waldorf, MD (2928 Festival Way)" >}}">in</a> <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Columbus, OH (3631 Soldano Blvd)" >}}">four</a> <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Lancaster, CA (44650 Valley Central Way)" >}}">other</a> <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Durham, NC (3724 Mayfair St)" >}}">stores</a>.</p>
<p>The store would have many similarities between one of the other Mini Unit stores in Durham, NC, having an almost identical interior and exterior when they both first opened.</p>
<p><h3> 1990s </h3></p>
<p>Sunland Park would open up with the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/SPT 1992 Remodel Program" >}}">SPT 1992 Remodel Program</a>, which was the standard for the time. Inside, the store would have the standard 90s decor, such as the CD Award parody posters, sports magazines, and planters. The store received the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Phase 1 (1994)" >}}">Phase 1</a> games package sometime in the early 90s. In the late 90s, the store would get updated signage and awnings on the exterior, and receive the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Phase 2 (1997)" >}}">Phase 2</a> games package.</p>
<p><h3> 2000s </h3></p>
<p>The store would receive minimal changes throughout the decade, and would only see a few changes, such as Chuck E. getting his derby hat changed out for a Cool Chuck cap in the early 2000s, while retaining the tuxedo, and the store would also receive the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Phase 3 (2000)" >}}">Phase 3</a> games package in the early 2000s.</p>
<p><h3> 2010s </h3></p>
<p>Sunland Park would start seeing lots of changes starting in the early 2010s, when in 2011, the store expanded, receiving the 2010 update to the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/CEC 2005 Remodel Program" >}}">CEC 2005 Remodel Program</a>, relocating the 1-Stage to the left-adjacent wall to where the stage used to sit in the corner, changing the store's layout, and receiving more games. They would also change their Cool Chuck cap to an Avenger cap, still keeping the tuxedo, until shortly after they would get the full Avenger outfit, removing the cap in 2013.</p>
<p><h3> 2020s/Present Day </h3></p>
<p>The store would also see some changes in the 2020s to present day, such as removing the Skytubes due to COVID-19.</p>
<p>Sunland Park would remodel and get the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/CEC 2018 20 Remodel Program" >}}">CEC 2018 2.0 Remodel Program</a> in April 2024, where they would remove their 1-Stage for a Chuck E. Live Stage (Dance Floor) and Video Wall, which is how the store still remains to this day.</p>
