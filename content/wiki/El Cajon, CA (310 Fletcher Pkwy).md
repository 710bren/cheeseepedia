**_310 Fletcher Pkwy**_ was a Pizza Time Theatre in El Cajon, California. The store opened in May 1982 with a [Balcony Stage]({{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage.md" >}}) and closed in 1993 (Possibly a few weeks or so before La Mesa's opening) with a Chuck E.'s House Facade (Chuck E.'s House Facade (C-Stage)).

It's possible that this store relocated to [La Mesa, CA (5500 Grossmont Center Dr)]({{< ref "wiki/La Mesa, CA (5500 Grossmont Center Dr).md" >}}) which is 10 minutes away from the location.

## History ##
El Cajon would open sometime in May 1982 (Date Unknown) in the former Kmart Foods Space with a [Balcony Stage]({{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage.md" >}}) as a Franchised location. This was one of many installed in California and was the 2nd or 3rd Pizza Time Theatre to open in the San Diego market. The store was then It is unknown if the store ever received the 1988 Remodel but they however converted the Balcony Stage to a [Chuck E.'s House Facade]({{< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House Facade.md" >}}) in 1989 or 1990. The store would remain this way until they closed sometime in 1993 (Possibly around July as the store is not that far from La Mesa and was in the same area). Sometime after that, the store was gutted and became part of the expansion of the neighboring Kmart store which would remain open until 2004 when it closed. Not long after that, the building was demolished for a Home Depot. As of April 2023, Home Depot still sits on the site.
