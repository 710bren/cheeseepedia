## History ##
TJ Hartford's would begin as a concept within CEC Corporate to grow their restaurant business. As a juxtaposition to Chuck E. Cheese's children-centered marketing strategy, TJ's would appeal to an adult demographic by being a large contemporary dining restaurant- including a bar and multiple dozen TV's scattered throughout the building for sports entertainment. CEC Corporate considered TJ's to be '-a new expansion vehicle to compliment our future growth strategy'.<ref name=':1'>https://web.archive.org/web/20020605030127/http://www.tjhartfords.com/company.html</ref>

The company would be created as **_TJH Restaurant Group, Inc.**_ in 2001. The first location would open on October 1, 2001<ref name=':0' />, though another source also states September 2001- possibly a soft opening.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20020209004806/http://dfw.citysearch.com/E/V/DALTX/0233/22/17/cs1.html</ref> The restaurant would feature arcade games for additional entertainment, crafting special tokens for the machines. At some point the company would switch to quarters for play.<ref>https://www.showbizpizza.com/ceccollect/related/index.html</ref>

Plans to open a second TJ's in 2002 would be considered, but never materialized.<ref>https://www.annualreports.com/HostedData/AnnualReportArchive/c/NYSE_CEC_2001.pdf</ref>

### Rebrand ###
By April of 2003 the company's logo would change from a more fancy design to a rougher bolder look, alongside its name changed from _TJ Hartford's Grill & Bar_ to _TJ Hartford's Sports Grille._ The company's website would also be given a brighter and flashier look, now with the slogan 'The Grill is on.' <ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20041129040954/http://tjhartfords.com/</ref>

### Marketing Changes ###
By mid-June of 2004, the company would reduce the cost for playing its arcade games from a quarter down to a nickel.
