**_Littleton, CO (7510 Parkway Dr)**_ is a _Chuck E. Cheese's_ that opened on February 15th, 2000 with a Studio C Alpha.

This store is known for it's appearance on the Food Network's _Unwrapped_. It went through multiple different acquisitions in the 90s until finally landing in Chuck E. Cheese's hands in 1999. It expanded in 2009, and received the 2.0 remodel in 2022.

##  Stages ## 
When Littleton opened, they had a Studio C Alpha stage. The interactive elements of the show, Blue Screen camera and Console, were both removed in early 2014. The Apple monitor on the stage also broke around this time. This monitor would eventually get covered with the decal off a token dispenser in November 2020. The animatronic and lighting elements of the show though were kept in peak condition until 2019. August 2019 saw a huge decline in show condition with the curtains breaking and many movements. This rapid deterioration would never stop. By 2021, many more lights and movements were broken including many showroom floods, warp light, multiple arm movements, Chuck's nose, and many more. In Summer 2021, the shows DTUs got set to bank 1, causing the lights to run off Chuck E.'s programming instead of their own. This show stayed in this sad state until it's unfortunate but long overdue removal during the 2.0 remodel in Summer 2022. The show was powered down for the last time on June 7, and stayed powered down until it was removed entirely on June 9. The store now features a 2021 Dance Floor with a Video Wall.

##  History ## 

###  Pre-CEC ### 
Before this location landing on it's permanent name as Chuck E. Cheese's, it was a few other brands before. It opened in 1994 as a Leaps & Bounds, a chain owned by McDonald's that primarily focused on the play structures. It was intended to compete with Discovery Zone, a major competitor of CEC at the time. The Leaps & Bounds brand was very short lived, as McDonald's realized they were entering a territory they didn't belong in, so the Leaps & Bounds brand merged with Discovery Zone. In 1995, Littleton would now be recognized as a Discovery Zone. Later on, in June 1999, Discovery Zone filed for bankruptcy. CEC Entertainment placed the winning bid in a bankruptcy auction, and got a ton of DZ's assets. Among this was 20 Discovery Zone fun centers. 10 of these would be converted into Chuck E. Cheese's over the next year. Among those 10 was Littleton. it reopened about 6 months later, now a Chuck E. Cheese's pizzeria.

###  Name confusion ### 
Over the years, this store has been called by many names by locals and fans. Some of these are 'Centennial' and 'Highlands Ranch', two of the three cities the store is located on the border of, 'Park Meadows', the mall the store is very close to, and then there's my personal favorite, 'The one next to Krispy Kreme'. The only two official titles though would be Littleton or Lone Tree. Back when it was built, the property was considered to be Littleton. In 1996 though, the city of Lone Tree was incorporated, taking up the space. Due to it being carried down through multiple acquisitions, it's original title has also been carried down. In recent years though, CEC has been attempting to rename it to Lone Tree as that's the city it's been for over 25 years.

###  2009 Remodel ### 
In 2009, Littleton received the 2009 update of the 2005 remodel. During this remodel, the store was expanded 3,792 ftÂ² out on the west side of the building. While the tubes did stay during this remodel, they would be replaced with Chuck E.'s Fun House in 2014. The big red awnings on the outside would be removed in late 2019

###  2.0 Remodel ### 
In 2022, Littleton received the 2.0 remodel. It began on May 23. This remodel originally was planned to be a regular remodel, but they decided to put up a custom Lone Tree mural instead of the 'Party' art.

##  Arcade Machines ## 
This list consists of all machines Littleton was planned to have after the 2.0 remodel. Some of these games were never received though or were replaced.
