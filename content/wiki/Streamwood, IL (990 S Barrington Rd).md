**_990 South Barrington Road**_ is a Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza/Chuck E. Cheese's that opened on March 6th, 1990, and closed in June 2014. This location was located right across from the Westview Shopping Center.

This location is notable for being featured in a 2007 semi-viral video where the 2-Stage animatronics pretend to have a shootout.

## History ##
### CEC (March 1990-June 2014) ###
Streamwood had it's grand opening on March 6th, 1990, and was built right across from the recently opened Westview Shopping Center. This store opened with the 1988 remodel and game package, with the stage being [Chuck E.'s House]({{< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House.md" >}}). Unfortunately, no photos or videos of Streamwood from back then have surfaced, and it is unknown if any exist. At an unknown date, this store would receive a [2-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/2-Stage.md" >}}), replacing the Chuck E.'s House stage it had opened with. They would also later receive the 1993 Remodel, getting new signage with Coach Chuck in a star cap. They would keep this remodel until they would close. This store would also likely receive the Phase 1, 2, and 3 game packages.

In June 2014, this store would close permanently, and would relocate to the larger [1000 S Barrington Rd]({{< ref "wiki/Streamwood, IL (1000 S Barrington Rd).md" >}}) store in the Westview Shopping Center across from the old store.

### Post CEC (June 2014-Present) ###
After the old store moved, the building would remain vacant for a few months, until a furniture store would take the space over, repainting the roof a grey color. The red doors used when the building was Chuck E. Cheese's would remain on the building. Sometime in 2017, the furniture store would permanently close, leaving the building yet again vacant.

As of April 2023, the original building is completely gone, and was demolished for a Andigo Credit Union drive-thru bank, later becoming a Consumer's Credit Union. The bank remains to this day.
