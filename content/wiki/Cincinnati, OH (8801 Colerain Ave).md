Concept Unification would be completed in May 1991. In the late 1990s Munch Jr would be removed from the 3-Stage with photos from the early 90s showing him fairly worn out.    

All Latex masks would be replaced with plastic masks by Winter 2002. In 2002 Chuck E.'s Tuxedo was replaced with Cool Chuck and Pizzacam would be removed from stage left being used for parts as late as 2005. In 2003 the base that the Chuck E. Cheese animatronic 'stood' on was removed. The following year (2004) would see more removals of affects and older latex cosmetics.

The front piece was installed by Moon and the left panel was installed by Building. Pasqually would also receive a new mask in 2008. In 2009 the original plastic mask for Chuck E. Cheese would be reinstalled before being replaced again with the 2006 mask a few months later. At the same time Helen & Munch would receive new masks.

##History##
The Colerain Ave Showbiz Pizza Place opened up November 11, 1981 opening in front of the former Gold Circle Mall as the 2nd Showbiz Pizza Store in Ohio (2nd after [Sharonville]({{< ref "wiki/Sharonville, OH (1429 E Kemper Rd).md" >}})). The store featured 'The Show Room, Sports Room, 60 Arcade games, a merry-go-round, and 'a magic cave'.' Fun Fact Colerain had unique showroom walls which unlike normal stores had an entrance in the middle of the wall. In 1982 apart of support for the Bengals getting into Super Bowl XVI Showbiz Pizza ran a promotion at Colerain & [Sharonville, OH (1429 E Kemper Rd)]({{< ref "wiki/Sharonville, OH (1429 E Kemper Rd).md" >}}). The event would happen January 24th in which you'd watch the event on a 'Wide Screen TV' and also bring in cans of soup in return 'Four Free Game Tokens and the soup goes to charity'. <ref>https://www.newspapers.com/image/100430208/?match=1</ref>   

In 1985 two events were held at the Showbiz one being the Greater Cincinnati Youth for Christ hosted a social on March 31st & June 16th from 8-11pm. The event was titled 'Night Light' which featured Pizza Buffet, Live Music from the Willoughby-Wilson Band.<ref>https://www.newspapers.com/image/101319173</ref> <ref>https://www.newspapers.com/image/101750853/</ref>The other event hosted was a 'Teen Dance' even which was a charity event to benefit the Muscular Dystrophy Association which would take place on July 12th.<ref>https://www.newspapers.com/image/101380480/</ref>

By 1987 Showbiz Pizza Place & Pizza Time Theatre had merged together with the ads beginning to reflect that. Since by that point every other SPP & PTT in the area had closed only Colerain & [Florence, KY (7635 Mall Rd)]({{< ref "wiki/Florence, KY (7635 Mall Rd).md" >}}) would be the only stores to show on these ads.<ref>https://www.newspapers.com/image/102005274/</ref>

In 1989 The original Showbiz Pizza Place sign would be removed with the Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza sign being installed in its place. Colerain would receive the [SPT 1988 Remodel Program]({{< ref "wiki/SPT 1988 Remodel Program.md" >}}) around the same time. This would remove the last remains of the Showbiz Pizza Place branding.<ref>https://www.newspapers.com/image/101584700/</ref>

Beginning in mid [Cincinnati, OH (4394 Eastgate Square Dr)]({{< ref "wiki/Cincinnati, OH (4394 Eastgate Square Dr).md" >}}) had begin showing up in advertisements in the area following its June 1990 opening. <ref>https://www.newspapers.com/image/102054270</ref>

In April 1991 the Rock Afire Explosion would undergo Concept Unification turning the show into [Munch's Make Believe Band]({{< ref "wiki/Concept Unification Stage.md" >}}). Then in late 1991 the Showbiz Pizza sign would be removed and replaced with a brand new 'Chuck E. Cheese's sign'<ref>https://www.newspapers.com/image/101584700/</ref>

on July 11th 1991 (11am-7pm) Chuck E. Cheese's would hold an open house for Assistant Restaurant Managers. Where you would visit and Dana Buck (Regional Recruiter) would tell all about the 'excellent starting salary along with a Great Quality of Life!'<ref>https://www.newspapers.com/image/102101322/</ref>

In late 1992 [Sharonville, OH (1429 E Kemper Rd)]({{< ref "wiki/Sharonville, OH (1429 E Kemper Rd).md" >}}) began to re-appear on advertisements as the store re-opened as a Chuck E. Cheese's after closing in 1984 as a Showbiz Pizza Place. Along with that [Louisville, KY (5743 Preston Hwy)]({{< ref "wiki/Louisville, KY (5743 Preston Hwy).md" >}}) would begin showing up on the advertisements despite not being nearby to other locations on said advertisements. The store is removed in November 1997 after closing.<ref>https://www.newspapers.com/image/101919542/</ref>  

on July 20, 1993 a 'Informational Open House' was held by 'Chuck E. Cheese's/ShowBiz' to tell restaurant managements the facts about their growth in 1993 and their 'livable' schedules. This event would also have 'Paul Scappechi, Regional V.P. and Dan High, District Manager' to visit It is interesting to note they both misspell Colerain as 'Collerain' and Chuck E. Cheese's as 'Chuch E. Cheese'<ref>https://www.newspapers.com/image/101952662/</ref>

Colerain would receive the [SPT 1992 Remodel Program]({{< ref "wiki/SPT 1992 Remodel Program.md" >}}) in 1992 at around the same time that Sharonville would open up. In the showroom Colerain featured 'Silver Awards' which were for the most part only installed in brand new 1992 stores. Despite that Colerain had 5 Silver Awards gaining them most likely due to Colerain and Sharonville opening/remodeling at the same time. 

In 1996 they would receive [Phase 1 (1994)]({{< ref "wiki/Phase 1 (1994).md" >}}) while also installing the standard Skytubes, New Game Package, and Kid Check the store would also receive new artwork such as the magazines and sports fixtures but also a new exterior replacing the 'Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza' one from 1990 with the new Star Chuck exterior sign and removing the 'Pizza' text from the exterior.  

Between 1997 - 1999 they would then receive [Phase 2 (1997)]({{< ref "wiki/Phase 2 (1997).md" >}}) this would be when they'd redesign the prize counter & a new game package.  

Lastly between 2001 - 2002 they would receive [Phase 3 (2000)]({{< ref "wiki/Phase 3 (2000).md" >}}) with the Toddler Zone installed near the right side of the restaurant by the Show Room Walls. <ref>https://decodedocdigitize.miraheze.org/wiki/Cincinnati,_OH_(8801_Colerain_Ave)#/media/File:CECcolerain019.jpg</ref>They'd also receive two new pieces of art. That being Big City (2001 Postcard) which was installed on the left wall of the Salad Bar <ref>https://decodedocdigitize.miraheze.org/wiki/Cincinnati,_OH_(8801_Colerain_Ave)#/media/File:2009.png</ref>& Toddler Zone Sandbox (CEC Décor) which was installed next to the new Toddler Zone.<ref>https://decodedocdigitize.miraheze.org/wiki/Cincinnati,_OH_(8801_Colerain_Ave)#/media/File:CECcolerain018.jpg</ref> 

In 2006 the store would receive a minor update which would revolve replacing all the booths in the showroom with the new [CEC 2005 Remodel Program]({{< ref "wiki/CEC 2005 Remodel Program.md" >}}) booths. They would also around the same time install a single [Red CEC Tickets (CEC Décor)]({{< ref "wiki/Red CEC Tickets (CEC Décor).md" >}}) near the entrance on the left wall. 

During Summer 2009 the store would receive the [CEC 2005 Remodel Program]({{< ref "wiki/CEC 2005 Remodel Program.md" >}}). During the remodel they'd receive a new game package and expand the store from 10,200 sq ft to 10,406 sq ft.<ref>https://www.showbizpizza.com/info/documents/spp/spp_sales_company_8-81_8-82.pdf</ref><ref>https://www.loopnet.com/property/8801-colerain-ave-cincinnati-oh-45251/39061-5100093002700/</ref>

In Winter 2014 the store would receive another Game Package replacing/removing several older games such as Tower of Power & Chuck E. Cheese's Photo Ride (1997). The Photo Ride being replaced with Chuck E. Cheese's Photo Ride (2014)

In April 2016, the Skytubes were removed allowing for increase in games. At the same time Colerain would receive a Game Package with several games older games being sent to other stores in the district such as [Columbus, OH (4284 Macsway Ave)]({{< ref "wiki/Columbus, OH (4284 Macsway Ave).md" >}})

In December 2016 the store would receive Play Pass.  

The Toddler Zone fence was removed in late 2017. Leaving a more open environment as no games were put in its place.   

Colerain would receive another Game Package in August 2018. At the same time the animatronic show would see increased maintenance which it hadn't seen since 2016.  

On September 22, 2019, Colerain would close after 38 years due to the owner of the property increasing rent on the lease and CEC Entertainment no longer seeing reason to keep the store open.  After closing some pieces of art were sent to [4394 Eastgate Square Dr]({{< ref "wiki/Cincinnati, OH (4394 Eastgate Square Dr).md" >}}). The posters sent over were _Grand Marshal of Games' (CEC Décor) (Grand Marshal of Games)', _Ambassador of Fun' (CEC Décor) (Ambassador of Fun)' and two ['Red CEC Tickets']({{< ref "wiki/Red CEC Tickets (CEC Décor).md" >}}), Along with several showroom chairs, the Kid Check stand, & Parts of arcade games such as 'Simpson Soccer' and 'Pop It for Gold'. The Parts computer was sent to [Lima, OH (2809 Elida Rd)]({{< ref "wiki/Lima, OH (2809 Elida Rd).md" >}}), Various show parts and the ended up being sent to [Springfield, OH (2345 Valley Loop Rd)]({{< ref "wiki/Springfield, OH (2345 Valley Loop Rd).md" >}}) along with all of the showroom booths being sent to replace the original Black & Green booths from the [SPT 1992 Remodel Program]({{< ref "wiki/SPT 1992 Remodel Program.md" >}}). An unused roll of carpet, Train Ride Statue, Tik Tak Chuck Statue, One of the [CEC Warhol - Quad (CEC Décor)]({{< ref "wiki/CEC Warhol - Quad (CEC Décor).md" >}}) posters, 'Good Behavior Guideline' sign, & The menus would end up at [Sharonville, OH (1429 E Kemper Rd)]({{< ref "wiki/Sharonville, OH (1429 E Kemper Rd).md" >}}).
