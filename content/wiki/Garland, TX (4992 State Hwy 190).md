##History##
The Sharonville, OH Showbiz Pizza Place opened up October 21, 1981 opening on the border of Sharonville. the store featured The Show Room, Sports Room, 60 Arcade games, a merry-go-round, and more This store remained unchanged from its opening due to the fact that on January 8, 1984 the store closed. This was due to a mix of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_crash_of_1983 Video Game Crash] and Showbiz having financial issues. For a few years the store was left vacant until the late 80s when a night club called 'Sneaker's' opened up. The night club then closed in the early 90s and a few years later a Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza which it has been since 1993. <ref>https://www.deviantart.com/jlamay</ref>

Opening September 8, 1992 the store still retained the Showbiz Pizza layout of the past but modified to fit the standards of a 1992 store. that mainly being the Salad Bar and Beverage Station being pushed towards the portion of the store where you order food. In replacement of the former Salad Bar/Beverage Station was the spot where the Toddler Zone was installed. There was also a new entrance next to the Toddler Zone which takes you straight into the kitchen which was most likely added during its days as a night club. The store remained this way until Summer 2005 when it was one of the first stores in the company to get the 2005 Remodel Package. Since it got it so early on over the years parts of the store would change to keep it updated with other Remodel 2005 stores. Such as removing the dim lights in 2010, adding the Pop Chuck posters and two more kid posters between 2005-2011. On June 22nd 2015 Mattie Thompson was robbed at the Chuck E. Cheese's<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsXD_d4y0pA</ref>. Skytubes were removed Spring 2016 along with the signage of the Toddler Zone. On December 8, 2017 the wall behind Chuck was painted green the same way stores that got the 2013 update to 2010 Remodel Package did. With this also removed one of the Avenger logo signs, moved the Toddler Zone playfort to the back wall and carpet put over the square of 90s Toddler Zone carpet. On April 28th 2019 a fight broke out in the parking lot leading to three adults and a child to hospitals<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9y7IpRrxE8</ref>

Then on October 8, 2019 Sharonville started it's 2.0 remodel the stage was removed October 30, 2019 as stated many times. With the new game package they also received a new color printer version of the photo ride but with Avenger Chuck this was a common manufacturing error with remodels from around 2018-2019. Along with that when replacing the bathroom doors they moved one of the old doors to be used as the entrance for the new control room but they didn't repaint the door so you see clear scars of where the signs once were with dents also in the wood. It's grand reopening happened on December 12, 2019. Despite the grand opening happening the store wasn't finished remodeling until January 2020. For a brief time in 2020 photos of the exterior pre and post 2.0 were installed over the bathroom markings which as of 2021 have been removed. Around February 2020 a small rockstar statue was put as display on the Prize Counter. Then in late 2020 the old TikTok Chuck statue was installed as a display for masks which came from the Colerain location after closing. As of 2022 the store is still the same and doing well and while it lacks a show you should check it out.
