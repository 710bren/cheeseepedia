## History ##
Escondido opened on January 3, 2007 as the very first CEC to open in 2007. It had the 2005 update to the [2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative]({{< ref "wiki/2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration  Major Remodel Initiative.md" >}}), which included late 2000s decor, Skytubes, and the Studio C Beta stage. Not much changed throughout the years, other than a few things. These include receiving new game packages, and removing the Skytubes. In December 2021, they received the 2.0 remodel, removing the Studio C Beta for a 2021 Model Dance Floor and Video Wall. As of July 2023, Escondido remains like this.
