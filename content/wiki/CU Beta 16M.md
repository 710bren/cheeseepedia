The **CU Beta 16m** is a stage format found at two [Chuck E. Cheese's]({{< ref "wiki/Chuck E Cheese's.md" >}}) locations in the state of Illinois in the United States that converted their 3-Stages in 2020. The stage is a [Studio C Beta]({{< ref "wiki/Studio C Beta.md" >}}), 16m but on a 3-Stage platform. It is the most recent CEC animatronic stage to come out, despite it not being an official stage type.
