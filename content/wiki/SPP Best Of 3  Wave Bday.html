<b><i>SPP Best Of 3 / Wave Bday</b></i> is one of the last few showtapes released for <i>Showbiz Pizza Place's</i> hosting the <i>Rock-afire Explosion</i>.

For some stores, this was the last tape used before <i>Concept Unification</i> would start at their location. Each tape sent after [SPP Christmas '89 / Wave Bday]({{< ref "wiki/SPP Christmas '89  Wave Bday.html" >}}) would become increasingly more rare as stores would convert to <i>3-Stages.</i>

Despite the later years of <i>Cyberstar</i> being mostly re-used segments from earlier showtapes, the last showtapes became the 'Best of' series, bringing back every single <i>Cyberstar</i> segment for stores to have. It was said at this time that due to the <i>Rock-afire Explosion</i> being phased out, stores could play whatever showtapes they had without sticking to the most recent show. The <i>Best of</i> series could be seen as an encouragement of this.
