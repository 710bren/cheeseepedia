The <b>Mr. Munch Cyberamic</b> is an animatronic figure created by Pizza Time Theatre Inc. for Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre locations from 1979-1980s and by other companies in the 1990s.

It is a pretty simple figure, having only 8 movements. The Mr. Munch Cyberamic would later be utilized in the Road Stage, 2-Stage, and 1-Stage shows as part of Munch's Make-Believe Band, changing his arms to play the keyboard correctly, and stopping his body turns.

<h2> History </h2>
This animatronic first premiered at the [Concord, CA (1975 Diamond Blvd)]({{< ref "wiki/Concord, CA (1975 Diamond Blvd).md" >}}) in 1979. The only changes to his look over the years were the addition of a baseball hat that read 'Munch' as well as legs and shoes.

<h2> Movements </h2>
The bot features 8-9 movements in total.
