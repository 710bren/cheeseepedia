The <b>Fishing (Magazine)</b> was a poster created for Chuck E. Cheese's around 1994-1995 for the 1990s Major Remodel.

<h2> Design[edit | edit source] </h2>
The poster is held in either a 20Â½' x 17', or 15' x 12' dark blue/red picture frame. The main photo of the poster depicts the Chuck Statue - Fisherman (shelf item) which has Chuck E. Cheese in a fishing outfit wearing a red baseball cap, long sleeve lumberjack shirt, jeans, fishing boots, and a bag while holding a fish.
