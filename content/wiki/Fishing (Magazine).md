The poster is held in a 20Â½ in. by 17 in. dark blue/red picture frame. The main photo of the poster depicts the Chuck Statue - Fisherman (shelf item) which has Chuck E. Cheese in a fishing outfit wearing a red baseball cap, long sleeve lumberjack shirt, jeans, fishing boots, and a bag while holding a fish.
