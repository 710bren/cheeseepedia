Live Stage (Dance Floor) (2019 Model Dance Floor), that store still operates to this day.

## History ##
Beaumont opened with either Harmony Howlette or Madame Oink; it's unknown if they had any cabaret or lounge characters as there's very little or no documentation of this location. Beaumont would later get Helen until the store's closure. 

After Beaumont closed in 1985, it's unknown what happened with the store's animatronic characters.
