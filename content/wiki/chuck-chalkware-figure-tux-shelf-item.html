<h2>Production</h2>
The statue would be produced by <i>Peeler Rose Productions</i> for the 1990s Major Remodel around 1994-1995, alongside the Chuck Statue- Tux (Shelf Item)|Tux, Chuck Statue- Director (Shelf Item)|Director, Chuck Statue- Coach (Shelf Item)|Coach, Chuck Statue- Baseball (Shelf Item)|Baseball, Chuck Statue- Football (Shelf Item)|Football, Chuck Statue- Hockey (Shelf Item)|Hockey, Chuck Statue- Basketball (Shelf Item)|Basketball, Chuck Statue- Cowboy (Shelf Item)|Cowboy, and <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Chuck Statue- Musician (Shelf Item)" >}}">Musician</a> statues.

<h2>Design</h2>
Unlike other statues produced, this one does not use any fabric similarly to the Chuck Chalkware Figure- Chaplin (Shelf Item)|Chuck Chaplin Statue. His head is larger than his body to mimic the designs of Esco Statues. He has a red derby, black and gold tuxedo, and a more rat like snout.
