**_Tokyo, Japan**_ was a planned _Chuck E. Cheese's_ that would have opened in Early 1999 with a Studio C Alpha.

##History##
On February 27, 1998, and article was published stating that ShowBiz Pizza Time had plans to open a Chuck E. Cheese’s in Japan. Tokyo was selected as the first location, and was expected to open in early 1999 after a franchisee was selected.<ref> https://adage.com/article/news/chuck-e-cheese-heads-japan/12898</ref>

Due to there being no other articles talking about the Tokyo store after this, it is assumed a franchisee was never found, and the plan for Chuck E. Cheese’s in Japan was called off.
