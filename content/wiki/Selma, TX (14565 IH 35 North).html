<b><i>14564 I-35 N, Store #583</b></i> known as <b>'Selma</b>' is a Chuck E. Cheese's that opened on December 13th, 2005 with a Studio C Beta.
<h2> History </h2>
Selma opened on December 13th, 2005 as a relocation of the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/San Antonio, TX (8220 Windsor Cross)" >}}">Windcrest</a> location. When the store opened, they had a Studio C 2000|Studio C 2000, 16m and the 2005 Update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative. In the Late 2000's-Early 2010's, certain pieces of decor were removed. In July 2017, Selma would become one of the first 7 CECs to receive the 2017 2.0 Remodel Program which involved the Studio C being removed for a 2017 Model Dance Floor. As of April 2023, Selma still has the 2017 Model Dance Floor and 2.0 Remodel.
