<p>Throughout the years, a number of stock music has been used in showtapes as instrumentals for songs, and background music for intermissions.</p>

<p><h3> Showbiz Era </h3></p>
<p>The earliest documented is in the 1984 Senior Citizen Show, with the second earliest being the 1984 Santa Show - often called 'Uncle Santa'.</p>
<p>During the Classical music skit in the 5th segment (Ballroom Dancing), Fatz plays a complex piano piece called <i>Ballade No. 4 in F Minor, Op. 52.</i> It has since been found to be a recording from <i>Bella Davidovich.</i> Interestingly, Fatz says 'Hey, this guy's good!', which breaks the fourth wall of him actually playing it.</p>
<p>Segment 4 of the same showtape (Startin' Something, Swingin' (Futuristic)) also utilises background audio while the Sun and Moon are joking about Lawrence Welk. The song playing in the background is called <i>[https://youtu.be/b6B0KNs7iSs?t=144 The Starlit Hour]</i>.</p>
<p>The Uncle Santa showtape contained the song instrumentals of <i>Holly Jolly Christmas</i> and <i>Jingle Jingle Jingle</i>. These were taken from the <i>Rudolph [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolph_the_Red-Nosed_Reindeer_(soundtrack) The Red Nosed Reindeer Soundtrack]</i> album which was recorded by the <i>Decca Concert Orchestra</i>. The second Santa segment also used <i>Holly Jolly Christmas</i> as the background music. The first segment also used an extract from John Klein's <i>Christmas Sound Spectacular Medley</i> which contained the cover of <i>Santa Claus Is Coming To Town</i>.</p>
<p>In Segment 1 of the 1987 <i>Homely For Christmas</i> showtape, a selection of songs from Act 1 of the <i>Nutcracker Ballet by Sir Charles Mackerras & London Symphony Orchestra</i> was used, that being <i>Act 1 Scene 2 (March)</i> and <i>Act 1 Scene 5 (Scene and Grandfather's Dance)</i>.</p>
<p>In the song 'Venus' in the <i>Tune Machine 2</i> showtape, a sample from [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_in_America_(James_Brown_song) James Brown's <i>Living In America</i>] was used, of which the moon is programmed to say.</p>
<p><h3> 90's Era </h3></p>
<p>In the 1990's CEI used karaoke tracks made by <i>Midifine Systems</i>, <i>BFM Hits</i>, and other unknown sources for their shows. These were especially used for their karaoke stages, in which a participant could sing along to the lyrics displayed on a video screen.</p>
<p>Some companies shared tracks for certain songs, meaning some artists stated may be inaccurate.</p>

<p><h3> Hannah Banana </h3></p>
<p>While producing the Hannah Banana Showtapes, CEI also used pre-made instrumentals to use as background music along with versions of RAE Showtapes without the vocals as removed in the multitracks:</p>
