<p><h2> History </h2></p>
<p>Dublin opened on October 11, 1993 as one of the first locations to open with the 1993 remodel. Dublin received the Phase 3 game package in Fall 2003, changing the exterior logo, relocating the showroom, tearing down balcony seating and showroom walls, replacing the 1-Stage with a Studio C 2000, 16M, and removing all older decor for Phase 3 decor. Dublin would remain like this until 2013 when they received the 2013 update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative, which involved replacing older decor for Rockstar decor, renovating the exterior, slightly expanding the location, relocating the showroom back to its original location, likely removing the Skytubes, and replaced the dim lighting with brighter lighting. In April 2024, the store would receive the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/CEC 2018 20 Remodel Program" >}}">2.0 Remodel</a>, removing the stage for a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Chuck E Live Stage (Dance Floor)" >}}">Dance Floor</a> and <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Video Wall" >}}">Video Wall</a>, which is how the store currently sits as of today.</p>
