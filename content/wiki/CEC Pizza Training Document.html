The <b><i>CEC Pizza Training Document</b></i> was a document consisting of 3 laminated pages used for training on pizza making, released at an unknown point around the 2000's.

The document goes over each step in making a standard pizza, not specific to any variant with toppings. It would be hung on the wall of the kitchen during its use.<ref>https://www.ebay.com/itm/304837044496</ref>
