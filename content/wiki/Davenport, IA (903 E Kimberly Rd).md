**_903 E Kimberly Rd**_ is a _Showbiz Pizza/Chuck E. Cheese_ that opened on February 25, 1981 as a franchised _ShowBiz Pizza Place_ with a [https://chuckepedia.com/wiki/Classic_Stage Rock-Afire Explosion]. It is located in the Old Town Shopping Center.
##History##
Davenport opened its doors in February 25th, 1981 with a Rock-afire Explosion show. It was originally a franchised-owned store and became a corporate-owned store. It is the second Showbiz Pizza in the state of Iowa. Like many other ShowBiz Pizza locations, it had a typical SPP layout seen in many other stores across the United States and would eventually receive the 1988 remodel years after it would open. Although very little documentation exists back in the ShowBiz days, it can be determined that Davenport was one of several locations to receive an Uncle Klunk show package (and a Santa Claus retrofit package as well) sometime after opening. Like many ShowBiz locations in the late 1980s, Davenport received the Showbiz Pizza Campground upgrade.

In around 1991/1992, Davenport received Concept Unification which converted the show to Munch's Make Believe Band. In September 16, 1996, the location was sold to corporate along with , Cedar Falls, and Cedar Rapids. In around the Mid-Late 1990's, Davenport received either [https://chuckepedia.com/wiki/Phase_1_(1994) Phase 1] or [https://chuckepedia.com/wiki/Phase_2_(1997) Phase 2] remodel which removed some early 90's decor and added new decor and SkyTubes. Davenport remained this way until sometime in 2006-2007 when they received the 2005 Remodel which involved removing the Showroom Walls, balcony Seating, and received a new exterior and they also expanded. They then received another exterior remodel in 2018 when the shopping center received a major remodel. They then received the 2.0 Remodel in September 2019 which causes the removal of the 3-Stage for the Dance Floor and Video Wall.
