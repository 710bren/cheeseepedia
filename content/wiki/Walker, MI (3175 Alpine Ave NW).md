<b><i>3175 Alpine Ave NW</b></i> was a <i>Showbiz Pizza Place</i>/<i>Chuck E. Cheese's</i> that opened on October 26th, 1982 as a corporate store with a Rock-Afire Explosion, the store closed in 2002 (Possibly Late August-Early September). The store was located next to Kmart in the former Kmart Foods (Later Eberhard Grocery Store) space.

This store relocated to [Walker, MI (3108 Alpine Ave NW)]({{< ref "wiki/Walker, MI (3108 Alpine Ave NW).md" >}}) which is still open to this day with a 2017 Model Chuck E. Live Stage (Dance Floor) (Dance Floor) and the 2017 2.0 Remodel Program (2.0 Remodel).

<h2> History </h2>

<h2>= Pre SPP/CEC (November 22nd, 1965-1982) </h2>=
The space that would house the Walker SPP/CEC would open on November 22nd, 1965 as a Kmart Foods Grocery Store which was the former Grocery Store division for Kmart. It would remain as Kmart Foods until it went out of business and then became a Eberhard Grocery Store which was closed by 1982, sometime after, the construction of the Walker Showbiz Pizza Place would begin with the opening occurring in October.

<h2>= Showbiz Pizza Place & Chuck E. Cheese (October 26th, 1982-1991 & 1991-2002) </h2>=
Walker opened on October 26th, 1982 as the third Showbiz Pizza Place in Michigan (3rd after [Southgate]({{< ref "wiki/Southgate, MI (15300 Toledo Rd).md" >}}) & [Saginaw]({{< ref "wiki/Saginaw, MI (5105 Bay Rd).md" >}})) as a Corporate owned store. Walker originally featured the Rock-Afire Explosion, as all other Showbiz locations did. they would have it for a few years, until around 1991, when they would receive Concept Unification, where the Rock-Afire Explosion characters were changed to the Chuck E. Cheese characters. In the Mid-Late 1990's, Walker would receive another remodel. The store would remain this way until they closed and relocated to [3108 Alpine Ave NW]({{< ref "wiki/Walker, MI (3108 Alpine Ave NW).md" >}}) in possibly the former Kids R Us in September 2002; they would open with a Studio C 2000 (Studio C 2000, 32m) and would have it until 2018 when it was replaced with a 2017 Model Chuck E. Live Stage (Dance Floor) (Dance Floor) and still operates to this day. 

<h2>= Post CEC (2002-Present) </h2>=
Sometime after the relocation and closure, the location's exterior along with the former Kmart next to it would be redone beyond recognition and converted into a Shopping Plaza called 'Summit Alpine'. As of May 2023, Summit Alpine still operates to this day.

<h2> Stages </h2>
Originally, Walker featured a Rock-Afire Explosion, as all other Showbiz locations did. In 1991, they would undergo Concept Unification, turning the Rock-Afire Explosion into the 3-Stage.

Walker would have the 3-Stage until 2002 (Possibly Late August-Early September) when the 3-Stage was removed due to the location permanently closing and relocating across the street.
