The <b><i>Sally Unlimited Corporate Office (567 Bishop Gate Ln, Jacksonville, FL)</b></i> was the offices for Sally Corporation for an unknown amount of years, with the only confirmed dates of residence being February 1979 to July 1980.<sup><a href="1">1</a></sup><sup><a href="2">2</a></sup>
It is unknown if the offices were used for manufacturing, or if this was leased to a separate building. One piece of footage from around the mid 90's shows a small manufacturing room that isn't the corporate office nor the later Sally Dark Rides Corporate Office.<sup><a href="3">3</a></sup>
