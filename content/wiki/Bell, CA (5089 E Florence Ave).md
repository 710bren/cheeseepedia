It is located in the Bell Shopping Center.
##History##
Bell opened sometime in 1982. Unfortunately, there is hardly any information when it was a PTT, but we do know they had a Balcony Stage. Bell had the stage and the store unchanged until the late 80's when they received the 1988 remodel. They removed the Balcony Stage for the C-Stage and added the early 90's decor. They would remain like this until their second remodel in the mid-late 90's. They then removed the C-Stage for the 2-Stage and removed the early 90's decor and added new decor and SkyTubes. They would remain like this until the 2005 remodel between 2007-2008 when they removed the Showroom Walls, Balcony Seating, and relocating the 2-Stage. Sometime in 2021, they received the 2.0 carpet. Currently, as of January 2023, they still have the 2-Stage and 2005 remodel and is safe from the 2.0 remodel.
##Stages##
Bell opened with the Balcony Stage in October 1981. Fortunately, there are a lot photos and videos to exist of Bell. Unfortunately however, they do not start filming until they are inside. So, the original exterior of Bell as a PTT is lost.
