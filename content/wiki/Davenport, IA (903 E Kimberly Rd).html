<p><h2>History</h2></p>
<p>Davenport opened its doors in February 25th, 1981 with a Rock-afire Explosion show. Davenport was originally a corporate-owned store before becoming franchised in 1984, and later became a corporate-owned store again in 1996. It was the second ShowBiz Pizza Place in the state of Iowa. Davenport would eventually receive the 80s Remodel between 1988-1990. Although very little documentation exists back in the ShowBiz days, it can be determined that Davenport was one of several locations to receive an Uncle Klunk show package (and a Santa Claus retrofit package as well) sometime after opening. Like many ShowBiz locations in the late 1980s, Davenport received the ShowBiz Pizza Campground upgrade.</p>
<p>In April 1991, Davenport received Concept Unification which converted the show to Munch's Make Believe Band. On September 16, 1996, the location was sold to corporate along with <a href="{{< ref "wiki/West Des Moines, IA (1431 22nd St)" >}}">West Des Moines</a>, Cedar Falls, and Cedar Rapids. In 1997, Davenport would receive a remodel which removed the late 80s decor and added new decor and SkyTubes. Davenport remained this way until sometime in 2006-2007 when they received the 00s Remodel which involved removing the Showroom walls, balcony seating, and received a new exterior. Davenport would receive another exterior remodel in 2018 when the shopping center received a major remodel. Davenport received the 2.0 Remodel in September 2019 which caused the removal of the 3-Stage for the Dance Floor.</p>
<p>On April 7, 2024, Davenport closed permanently after 43 years of operation.</p>
