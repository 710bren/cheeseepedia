<b><i>Mitzi Mozzarella</b></i> is one of the main characters of the Showbiz Pizza Place franchise, having made her debut as an animatronic at <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Jacksonville, FL (9820 Atlantic Blvd)" >}}">Jacksonville, FL (9820 Atlantic Blvd)</a>.
<h2> History </h2>
<h3> Origins </h3>
Mitzi Mozzarella was based off of the character Mini Mozzarella from the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Wolf Pack 5" >}}">Wolf Pack 5</a>. She borrowed her voice, and had a similar appearance. She had a cheerleader outfit, as well as blonde hair. She got her first animatronic in <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Jacksonville, FL (9820 Atlantic Blvd)" >}}">Jacksonville, FL (9820 Atlantic Blvd)</a>. She was a youthful mouse, who was one of the lead vocalists for the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Rock-afire Explosion" >}}">Rock-afire Explosion</a>.
<h3> Showbiz Pizza Place </h3>
Initially, Mitzi Mozzarella was voiced by Aaron Fechter. This version of the character was short lived, and had a much higher pitched voice. Mitzi soon got her permanent voice actor, Shalisa Sloan James. Mitzi would be portrayed as a stereotypical teenage girl, and would describe herself as liking boys, cars, and more. Her and <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Dook Larue (Animatronic)" >}}">Dook Larue</a> would receive second generation animatronics, but they were never mass produced. During <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Concept Unification" >}}">Concept Unification</a>, several Mitzi Mozzarella animatronics would be retrofitted into <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Mitzi Mozzarella (Animatronic)" >}}">Helen Henny</a>. Helen as a character would be inspired by Mitzi going forward.
<h3> The New Rock-afire Explosion </h3>
After <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Concept Unification" >}}">Concept Unification</a>, Creative Engineering wanted to find a new way to bring the Rock-afire Explosion back into the public spotlight. They developed the New Rock-afire Explosion. Every character was changed, including Mitzi. Mitzi was now portrayed as older, and wore a black dress.
<h3> Present Day </h3>
Mitzi's voice actor returned throughout the 21st century to make new songs. In these new shows, it was clear that Mitzi was a lot different than her Original youthful self. Original parts for Mitzi would start to be reproduced by Creative Engineering's new employees in 2023.
