The **_Bear Country Jubilee**_ was a Creative Engineering show that premiered in the Spring of 1978. This was the second, complete animatronic show built by CEI following _[Jingle Bell Jamboree]({{< ref "wiki/Jingle Bell Jamboree.md" >}})_ at [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa's_Village_(Jefferson,_New_Hampshire) Santa's Village]. The show was only installed at two locations, those being [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morey%27s_Piers Morey's Pier] in Wildwood, New Jersey, and the now-defunct [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeSourdsville_Lake_Amusement_Park Americana Amusement Park] in Middleton, Ohio.

## History ##
In the year 1977, Creative Engineering was commissioned to develop what would become the company's first complete animatronic shows. The _[Jingle Bell Jamboree]({{< ref "wiki/Jingle Bell Jamboree.md" >}})_ for [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa's_Village_(Jefferson,_New_Hampshire) Santa's Village] was the first of these shows to be developed, followed by the Bear Country Jubilee for the then-rebranded [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeSourdsville_Lake_Amusement_Park Americana Amusement Park] (previously _LeSourdsville Lake Amusement Park_). Both shows, loosely inspired by Disney's _[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_Bear_Jamboree Country Bear Jamboree]_, premiered in the Spring of 1978.<ref>https://showbizpizza.com/info/promo/cei/cei_1977promo.pdf</ref>

The _Bear Country Jubilee_ served as a predecessor show to the [_Hard Luck Bears_]({{< ref "wiki/Hard Luck Bears.md" >}}) (which was initially titled the _Country Bear Jubilee_ upon creation), which in turn preceded CEI's well-known [_Rock-afire Explosion_]({{< ref "wiki/Rock-afire Explosion.md" >}}).

## Installations ##

### (LeSourdsville Lake) Americana Amusement Park ###
As part of a $3.5 million, three-year renovation plan, the LeSourdsville Lake Amusement Park (which recently rebranded to Americana at the time) commissioned the first installation of CEI's _Bear Country Jubilee_ for a Spring 1978 premiere. The show's debut at Americana could be considered the first American animatronic show modeled after the _Country Bears_ for use at a regional amusement park. During its initial years of operation, the BCJ was very popular at the Americana park, with a long lifespan well into the 1990s. By this time, however, the show was susceptible to major technical issues, with some accounts of interruptions in mid-performances. By 1999, the show was decommissioned, with the fate of the animatronic figures and props unknown. The theater was left completely abandoned, even after the rest of the park closed in 2002. The stage framing for the show remained intact for many years but was removed with time. By 2018, remains of LeSourdsville, including the abandoned theater building for the _Bear Country Jubilee_, were demolished for the Monroe Bicentennial Commons.

### Morey's Pier ###
Also in 1978, Morey's Pier commissioned a _Bear Country Jubilee_ of their own from Creative Engineering. As a means to house an animatronic show, the pier's 'Safari' dark ride was gutted and transformed into the **Bear Country Jubilee_ Opera House.' A modified [Friendly Freddy]({{< ref "wiki/Friendly Freddy (Animatronic).md" >}}) animatronic peered from a window above the entrance, likely serving as a barker bear encouraging park guests to come inside. The show itself was almost identical to Americana's show with only a few differences. Ratzo, a character CEI created for a past client, appeared from atop a balcony across from the stage. New characters alleged to have been part of Morey's BCJ were Mortimer the Moose and Buford the Buffalo, two trophy heads that were strikingly similar to the _Country Bears** own Melvin the Moose and Buff the Buffalo in personality and presentation. With these in mind, it's possible that an all-new showtape was made.

Following the release of Creative Engineering's successor to the _Bear Country Jubilee_ in the form of the _Hard Luck Bears_ for 1980, the existing bear show installation at Morey's Pier was updated to accommodate aspects from the new bear show, including an N. J. Bear Show (edited variant of the _Hard Luck Bears_ soundtrack) exclusive to the pier. As a result, character names were changed to those from the new HLB, two skits with Mortimer Moose and Buford Buffalo were recorded before the show's official start and halfway through the runtime, characters were given new props (a fishing pole for Fingers Dan / Billy Bill and a 'dead chicken' for Waldo / Repeat), as well as a Choo Choo prop installed beside the bench of Fingers Dan / Billy Bill to name a few. 

The most unusual, yet interesting addition to Morey's installation at this time was a country-clothed [Fats Abdomino]({{< ref "wiki/Fats Gorilla (Animatronic).md" >}}) animatronic paired with the head of Mama Granbags (modeled after the Beatrice Bear figure from BCJ) inside of his piano. Most likely replacing Friendly Freddy, the Granbags and Fats animatronics served as new barkers for attracting park guests to the opera house. The soundtrack for these two characters follows the timeframe of events mentioned in the _Hard Luck Bears_ showtape, where Granbags reprimands a gorilla for allegedly telling lies about her sons, which is paid off through their banter outside the theater. The vain gorilla performs song ditties on his piano as he proudly proclaims how everybody loves him for being the greatest and the best. That is until he is immediately scolded by Granbags, who praises her boys' talents and morals (Billy Wilbur especially) in comparison to the 'banana-brained' gorilla. As Granbags prepares for showtime, she encourages guests to wait thirteen minutes for the next show to start, kindly asking the gorilla not to tell any further lies. The gorilla begrudgingly complies, taking Granbags' absence as an opportunity to 'snooze.'

Similarly to Americana's installation, Morey's BCJ fell under disrepair in its final years, even after the 1981 updates. At the end of the 1984 operating season, the entirety of the _Bear Country Jubilee_, as well as the additional Fats and Granbags animatronics, were sent back to Creative Engineering.<ref>https://youtu.be/0l6-6ewuY70?si=FXtBU7r9Yfgwl762&t=1545</ref> It was when the show arrived back in Orlando that CEI completely refurbished the characters and upgraded the technology to the [Rock-afire Explosion Control System]({{< ref "wiki/Rock-afire Explosion Control System.md" >}}), replacing the show's original Tone Decoder Control System from 1978. Although the show was restored, it was ultimately never sold to another client and thus sat unused in Creative Engineering's facilities from then on. In 2022, the characters and props were relocated to the all-new [Creative Engineering Workshop]({{< ref "wiki/Creative Engineering Workshop.md" >}}) in Crescent City, where they are to be stored until the future development of a [Creative Engineering Museum]({{< ref "wiki/Creative Engineering Museum.md" >}}) occurs.
