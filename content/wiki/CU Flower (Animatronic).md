The **CU Flower Animatronic** was an animatronic figure that was on the early 3-Stages in Texas. Its only movement was its mouth and it used Dook's left ear bit as it wasn't being used at the time. they stopped programming it in the mid-late 90's, and by then there were most likely very few, as the finalized 3-Stage (slightly different than what Dallas Montfort got) did not include them, but they do appear in the 1993 3-Stage Diagnostics.
