<p><b><i>York, PA (351 Loucks Rd)</b></i> was a <i>Pizza Time Theatre</i> location that opened on August 23, 1983 and closed on February 19, 1984 with a Balcony Stage and unknown cabaret/lounge acts. Very little is known about this location, mainly because it was either undocumented, or short lived.</p>
<p>This location is not to be confused with the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/York, PA (2801 E Market St)" >}}">current location</a>, which opened on March 4, 1983 as a Showbiz Pizza Place, received CU in 1991, and is still open today with the 2.0 remodel.</p>
