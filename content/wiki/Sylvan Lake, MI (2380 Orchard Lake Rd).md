The Pizza Time Theater in Sylvan Lake, MI originally opened in September 1981<ref>https://www.showbizpizza.com/info/documents/ptt/ptt_pizzatimes1-2.pdf </ref>.  

The original PTT was closed at an unknown date, but the location was later used to house a Little Caesars Family Fun Pizzeria / Caesarland restaurant. This is a common outcome of many of the locations franchised by Mike Ilitch, including Clawson / Troy, MI (1241 E 14 Mile Rd) (Clawson, MI) and [Westland MI.]({{< ref "wiki/Westland MI (208 S Wayne Rd).md" >}})
