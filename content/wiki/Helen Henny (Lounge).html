The <b><i>Lounge</b></i> <b><i>Helen Henny <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics" >}}">Cyberamics</a></b></i> were a set of around 2 animatronic figures created by <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Pizza Time Theatre" >}}">Pizza Time Theatre</a> from 1979 to 1980 for Lounge acts. They were designed after the PTT guest star, <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Helen Henny" >}}">Helen Henny</a>.
There are very little known to be produced as she was immediately replaced by <a href="{{< ref "wiki/The King  King Kat (Lounge)" >}}">The King</a>, though later Helen Henny cosmetics were created for the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Guest Star  Helen Henny (Cyberamic)" >}}">Guest Star Cyberamics</a>, which became the only ones after the merger.
