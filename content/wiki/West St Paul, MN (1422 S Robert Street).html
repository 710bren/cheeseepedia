<b><i>1422 S Robert Street</b></i> was a <i>Showbiz Pizza Place</i> that opened on September 23, 1982, and closed in October 1985.

The location became a Circus Pizza around 1988 and closed in the mid-1990's. 

After Circus Pizza's departure, the location became a <i>Chuck E. Cheese's</i> on August 9, 1999, and closed in the fall of 2019.
<h2>Stages</h2>
Originally, this location opened with the [Classic Stage]({{< ref "wiki/Classic Stage.html" >}}). The Circus Pizza that followed also had a classic Rock-afire Explosion show, but it is unclear if the same animatronics were used.

When Chuck E. Cheese opened in August 1999, the show was replaced by a [Studio C Alpha]({{< ref "wiki/Studio C Alpha.html" >}}). However, this Studio C Alpha stage was unique in that it used the original footprint of the existing stage, similar to that of the [Awesome Adventure Machine]({{< ref "wiki/Awesome Adventure Machine.html" >}}) or the [Darien, IL (7409 Cass Ave)]({{< ref "wiki/Darien, IL (7409 Cass Ave).html" >}}) location's [CU Beta 16M]({{< ref "wiki/CU Beta 16M.html" >}}). The show did not feature the Apple TV. Additionally, the stage used an earlier version of the [Chuck E. Cheese 32m (Animatronic)]({{< ref "wiki/Chuck E Cheese 32m (Animatronic).html" >}}) that had eyelashes <ref></ref>.

In 2005, the curtains were disabled on the stage. In 2013, Chuck E.'s cap was replaced.

<h2>History </h2>
As a <i>Chuck E. Cheese's</i>, the store re-opened to resemble the [SPT 1992 Remodel Program]({{< ref "wiki/SPT 1992 Remodel Program.html" >}}) and included character posters and other fixtures from the 1998/1999 art packages.

It was sometime between 2006 and 2007 when the location was updated for the [CEC 2005 Remodel Program]({{< ref "wiki/CEC 2005 Remodel Program.html" >}}), in which only the interior was remodeled. The interior remodel led to the removal of the Showroom Walls and Balcony Seating, and the salad bar was relocated, along with a few existing arcade machines.

In Summer 2013, the location received a new walkaround character costume.

The location closed in the fall of 2019. After it closed, the building was gutted and was replaced by a AutoZone.
