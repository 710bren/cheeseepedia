<b><i>1422 S Robert Street</b></i> was a <i>Showbiz Pizza Place</i> that opened on September 23, 1982, and closed in October 1985.
The location became a Circus Pizza around 1988 and closed in the mid-1990's.
After Circus Pizza's departure, the location became a <i>Chuck E. Cheese's</i> on August 9, 1999, and closed in the fall of 2019.
<h2>Stages</h2>
Originally, this location opened with the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Classic Stage" >}}">Classic Stage</a>. The Circus Pizza that followed also had a classic Rock-afire Explosion show, but it is unclear if the same animatronics were used.
When Chuck E. Cheese opened in August 1999, the show was replaced by a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Studio C Alpha" >}}">Studio C Alpha</a>. However, this Studio C Alpha stage was unique in that it used the original footprint of the existing stage, similar to that of the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Awesome Adventure Machine" >}}">Awesome Adventure Machine</a> or the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Darien, IL (7409 Cass Ave)" >}}">Darien, IL (7409 Cass Ave)</a> location's <a href="{{< ref "wiki/CU Beta 16M" >}}">CU Beta 16M</a>. The show did not feature the Apple TV. Additionally, the stage used an earlier version of the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Chuck E Cheese 32m (Animatronic)" >}}">Chuck E. Cheese 32m (Animatronic)</a> that had eyelashes <sup>(1)</sup>.
In 2005, the curtains were disabled on the stage. In 2013, Chuck E.'s cap was replaced.
<h2>History </h2>
As a <i>Chuck E. Cheese's</i>, the store re-opened to resemble the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/SPT 1992 Remodel Program" >}}">SPT 1992 Remodel Program</a> and included character posters and other fixtures from the 1998/1999 art packages.
It was sometime between 2006 and 2007 when the location was updated for the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/CEC 2005 Remodel Program" >}}">CEC 2005 Remodel Program</a>, in which only the interior was remodeled. The interior remodel led to the removal of the Showroom Walls and Balcony Seating, and the salad bar was relocated, along with a few existing arcade machines.
In Summer 2013, the location received a new walkaround character costume.
The location closed in the fall of 2019. After it closed, the building was gutted and was replaced by a AutoZone.
