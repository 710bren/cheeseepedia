<p><h2> History </h2></p>
<p><h3> Celebration Station (June 1982 - late '80s) </h3></p>
<p>Before opening in 1988, this location was originally a Celebration Station that opened in June 1982. Not much is known about Rockford's Celebration Station, other than it closed in the late '80s. In 1988, McBiz Corp purchased the space, and conversion into a CEC began.</p>
<p><h3> Chuck E. Cheese's (October 30, 1988 - present) </h3></p>
<p>By the Fall of 1988, the conversion was completed, and was ready to open. The store finally opened on October 30, 1988 with a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House" >}}">Rocker Stage</a> and the 1988 remodel, and the restaurant was named 'ShowBiz Pizza'.
