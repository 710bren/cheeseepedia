##Stages##
When National City opened, it housed a Balcony Stage. Unfortunately, there is only one photo of National City as a PTT and that is the exterior but partial. There are also no videos to exist of National City as a PTT. 

Sometime between 1989 and 1990, they installed Chuck E.â€™s House Facade.

In the early 90's, the Chuck E.'s House Facade stage was removed and the 2-Stage was Installed.

In 2011, the 2-Stage was converted into the 1-Stage.

##History##
National City opened in May 1982 with a [https://chuckepedia.com/wiki/Cyberamics_Balcony_Stage Balcony Stage] and was originally a franchised-owned store until the corporate bought it on October 22, 1984 along with many other locations. They then received the 1988 remodel around 1988-1989 when the stage was replaced with [https://chuckepedia.com/wiki/Chuck_E.'s_House_Facade Chuck E.'s House Facade] and removed older PTT decor and received an exterior change. In the Early 90's, they received Phase 2 which removed some older decor, added decor, got another exterior change, and replaced C-Stage with the 2-Stage. In the Mid to Late 90's they received the Phase 3 remodel which removed the older early 90's decor and added the late 90's/2000's decor, added SkyTubes and Toddler Zone, removed the ball pit, and received another exterior change. In 2007-2008, National City received the 2005 remodel (Phase 4) which removed the Showroom Walls, Balcony Seating, relocated the stage, and received another exterior change. Sometime in 2011, they expanded the store and the 2-Stage was converted into the 1-Stage. Pico Rivera also converted their 2-Stage into the 1-Stage a year prior in 2010. They also have the Pointing Avenger Chuck sign at the back of the store next to a former HomeTown Buffet. It tells you to go to the front side of the store. Currently, as of February 2023, they still have the 1-Stage, the 2005 remodel, and the rare Pointing Chuck sign.
