<p><b><i>1639 Rt 23, Store #489</b></i> is a Chuck E. Cheese that opened on April 20, 1992, with a Road Stage and is still open to this day.</p>
<p>It is located in the Brentwood Plaza Shopping Center.</p>
<p>This is not to be confused with the Wayne, NJ (29 NJ-23) Pizza Time Theatre which opened on October 18th, 1982, and closed in 1986 with a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage" >}}">Balcony Stage</a>.</p>
<p><h2> History </h2></p>
<p>The store opened on April 20th, 1992 as the last of two Road Stages in New Jersey (<a href="{{< ref "wiki/Deptford, NJ (1500 Almonesson Rd)" >}}">Deptford</a> is the other which opened a few months earlier on November 12th, 1991) and was one of the last locations to open with one.</p>
<p><h3> Phase Remodels </h3></p>
<p>Wayne opened with the 1988 Remodel, with their main gameroom being on the left of the store and the (mostly) kitty area being on the right side. Later in the 90s, the store would receive <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Phase 1 (1994)" >}}">Phase 1</a>, including a refreshed 'Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza' sign. Then by 2003, the store would remove their Showroom Walls and Balcony Seating. In 2006, Wayne received the 2005 remodel which involved the Kiddy Room and gameroom being swapped to the opposite sides, removed older decor for newer decor, and received an exterior change. In May of 2011, Wayne received an expansion to the right side of the store, allowing more space for games in the store. In 2016, the Brentwood Plaza Shopping Center received an exterior remodel resulting in Wayne getting a Phase 5 sign, but not a full remodel.</p>
<p><h3> 2.0 Remodel </h3></p>
<p>Wayne 2.0 remodel was scheduled to have started in the Early Summer of 2022 though, after issues, the remodel began in Fall of 2022. At the time the store was remodeling, it was temporarily closed, as a part of their extensive remodel, but leaving many visitors that drove to the store just to find locked doors. After the remodel was finished the store was left with a video wall towards the top right of the store, a 2019 Dance Floor, and a brand new, modern look.</p>
<p><h3> 'The Incident' (July 30, 2022) </h3></p>
<p>On July 30th, 2022, an incident occurred where a black girl was ignored by a person in the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Chuck E Cheese" >}}">Chuck E. Cheese</a> walkaround, this caused a massive outcry over Chuck E. Cheese's being racist, although many defenders, both Chuck E. Cheese fans and casual visitors, defended CEC Entertainment, stating that the walkaround costumes mask, manufactured by Cowan Costumes, has limited visibility. Nonetheless, CEC Entertainment started a diversity training program in August, and David McKillips personally visited Wayne.</p>
