The <b><i>Chuck E. Cheese 32 / 16 Movement Hybrid</b></i> is an animatronic found at the [[Pittsburgh, PA (20 McIntyre Square Dr)|Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] Chuck E. Cheese's store. The Bot has [[Chuck E. Cheese 32m (Animatronic)|the standard 32 movement lower half]] with the head mech being replaced with [[Chuck E. Cheese 16m (Animatronic)|a 16 movement head mech]] which came from the [[Leominster, MA (132 Sacks Blvd)|Leominster, MA store]]. The original head was discarded for parts. They simply removed the original head and installed the new one with no modifications made to the bot to install it.
