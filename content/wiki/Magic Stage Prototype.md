The _Magic Stage_ was a test stage made by Showbiz Pizza Place with the objective to stray away from Rock-afire Explosion branding as a result of licensing conflicts between Creative Engineering and Showbiz Pizza.

## History ##
The magic stage was installed in November of 1985 at only one location- most likely at the Longview, TX (1905 W Loop 281) Showbiz Pizza Place. Contrary to popular assumption, the showtape created for the magic stage actually had no correlation with the magic night showtape released in 1984. Christmas songs were reused with an added custom countdown and introduction by an off-stage announcer before each song. 

### Austin, TX (8038 Burnet Rd) ###
Sometime later, the Austin, TX (8038 Burnet Rd) Showbiz Pizza Place would obtain the magic stage cosmetics. The stage was outfitted with each character costume and the valance (minus the 'MAGIC' lettering) until Concept Unification.
