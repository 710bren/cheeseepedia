Green Bay originally featured the Rock-Afire Explosion, as all other Showbiz locations did. they would have it for a few years, until around 1991, when they would receive the 1988 remodel, receiving Concept Unification, where the Rock-Afire Explosion characters were changed to the Chuck E. Cheese characters, and removing all SPP decor for newer decor.

In around 1999/2000, Grand Rapids would receive the another remodel which removed all older 90's decor, added newer decor, removed the 3-Stage for the Studio C Alpha, and added SkyTubes. In 2006-2007, Arlington Heights received the 2005 Update to the [[2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative]] removing older decor, removing the Showroom Walls, Balcony Seating, and painting the walls purple, and adding bright florescent lighting. As of May 2023, Grand Rapids still has the 2005 Update and Studio C Alpha.
