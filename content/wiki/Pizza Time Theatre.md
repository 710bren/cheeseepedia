Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre**_ (Also known as just **_Pizza Time Theatre**_) was a pizza chain created by Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell in 1977, lasting up until 1984 where it filed for bankruptcy and was merged into the competing [[ShowBiz Pizza Place]], where it would later be named just [[Chuck E. Cheese's]].

###  1977 ### 

####  February #### 

* Sometime within the month an internal announcement at Atari would be made regarding the future [[San Jose, CA (370 S Winchester Blvd)]] store. It is unclear what form this announcement was made, but likely could have been a prior unseen issue of the Gospel of St. Pong.<ref>https://archive.org/details/the-gospel-of-st.-pong-revisited-vol-4-april-1977</ref> The announcement is described as being made by Chuck E. Cheese himself, stating to 'hang on a bit longer until the new restaurant is opened', citing delays with the city of San Jose- likely related to permits.<ref>https://archive.org/details/atariincbusiness0000gold/page/216/mode/2up?q=chuck+e</ref>
