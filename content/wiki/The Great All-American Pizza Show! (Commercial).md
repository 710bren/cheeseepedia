The <b><i>Great All-American Pizza Show! 60s</b></i> is a lost 60 second commercial that aired in local television stations in 1979 to promote the 'The Great All American Pizza Show!' media promotion. 
<h2>History</h2>
*The commercial was filmed at the <i>[San Jose, CA (370 S Winchester Blvd)]({{< ref "wiki/San Jose, CA (370 S Winchester Blvd).md" >}})</i> and <i>[San Jose, CA (1371 Kooser Rd)]({{< ref "wiki/San Jose, CA (1371 Kooser Rd).md" >}})</i> locations.
*Whilst the only surviving audio from a radio advertisement only advertises the <i>[San Jose, CA (370 S Winchester Blvd)]({{< ref "wiki/San Jose, CA (370 S Winchester Blvd).md" >}})</i> and <i>[San Jose, CA (1371 Kooser Rd)]({{< ref "wiki/San Jose, CA (1371 Kooser Rd).md" >}})</i> locations, it was mentioned in the 79' brochure that the ad would also advertise potential franchisee stores.
*The dialogue is different than the one featured in the <i>[The Great All-American Pizza Show! (Radio Ad)]({{< ref "wiki/The Great All-American Pizza Show! (Radio Ad).md" >}})</i> , although shares many lines.
*It is rumored that Crusty's voice actor portrayed Chuck E.'s voice in the commercial.
