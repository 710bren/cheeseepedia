The **_Great All-American Pizza Show! 60s**_ was a 60 second commercial that aired in local television stations in 1979 to promote the 'The Great All American Pizza Show!' media promotion. 
## Cast## 
*It is rumored that Crusty's voice actor portrayed Chuck E.'s voice in the commercial.
## Notes## 
*The commercial was filmed at the _[[San Jose, CA (370 S Winchester Blvd)]]_ and _[[San Jose, CA (1371 Kooser Rd)]]_ locations.
*Whilst the only surviving audio from a radio advertisement only advertises the _[[San Jose, CA (370 S Winchester Blvd)]]_ and _[[San Jose, CA (1371 Kooser Rd)]]_ locations, it was mentioned in the 79' brochure that the ad would also advertise potential franchisee stores.
*The ad features up-close shots of the _[\2](\1)_ and _[\2](\1)_ animatronics.
*The dialogue is different then the one featured in the _[[The Great All-American Pizza Show! (Radio Ad)]]_ , although shares many lines.
