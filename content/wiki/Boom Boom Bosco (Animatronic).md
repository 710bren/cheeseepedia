{{Animatronic|releasedate=1978|manufacturer=Creative Engineering|image=bosco.jpg|unitsProduced=2}}Boom Boom Bosco was created for the [Bear Country Jubilee]({{< ref "wiki/Bear Country Jubilee.md" >}}) which was sold to Americana Amusement Park and Morey's Piers. His mask mold was later reused for Beach Bear in the [Wolf Pack 5]({{< ref "wiki/Wolf Pack 5.md" >}}).

## History ##
Boom Boom Bosco along with the Bear Country Jubilee show was developed from 1977 - 1978. One show would be sold to Americana Amusement Park in Monroe, Ohio. The current whereabouts of the show is unknown. A 2nd show was sold to Morey's Piers in Wildwood, New Jersey. This show was sold back to CEI in 1984<ref>https://youtu.be/0l6-6ewuY70?si=bQxFDYb6kqSK55V0&t=1545</ref> and currently resides at the CEI museum<ref>https://youtu.be/2XtudCa0Vpk?si=Lsf_jXFK3uhw1ebF&t=655</ref>.

## Design ##
In his design for Americana Amusement Park, he wore a blue vest with yellow flowers and stars. At Morey's Piers, he wore a long, yellow and red striped tie similar to Billy Bob's overalls. He has gray fur and plays the double bass.

## Movements ##
Due to lack of footage or photos of internals, movements can only be inferred. All that is known is that he along with the rest of the bots in the show had very limited movement.
