Attleboro opened October 4th, 1993, in Marketplace Square (Formerly South Attleboro Square), with a [1-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/1-Stage.md" >}}){< ref "wiki/1-Stage.md" >}}). By 2003, A Sprinkler Room, Up & Down Curtains, &  were added.

In Fall 2006, Attleboro would remodel to the 2005 Remodel and expand (Which relocated the showroom, rebuilding the stage in the process.

In September 2013, Chuck's Derby was removed, following the Tuxedo in 2014, declaring the Tuxedo & Derby outfit in-store extinct.

In October 2019, Attleboro started remodeling to 2.0, removing the 1-Stage on November 11, 2019 and installing the 2019 Model Dance Floor.
