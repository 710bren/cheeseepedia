The _Monkey Show_ is an animatronic show type that has been manufactured by Hofmann Figuren since 1977. These ensemble shows are best known to be the first of Hofmann's animatronic creations, as well as the first animatronic shows to debut outside of the United States.

##  Die Klimbimski Affentheater ## 

###  Phantasialand (1977-1983) ### 
The first of the Hofmann monkey shows, **_Die Klimbimski Affentheater Show**_ was built exclusively for the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantasialand Phantasialand] theme park in Brühl, Germany. Premiering with the debut of the park's Scala theater in 1977, the show consisted of 22 animated figures (2 parrots, 2 bears, and 18 monkeys). The stage design was a direct rip-off of Disney's [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_Bear_Jamboree Country Bear Jamboree] stage, with one large center stage in between four side stages (5 stages in all) all topped with detailed prosceniums. The original German soundtrack for Die Klimbimski-Show is estimated to have a runtime of 30 minutes, structured in a similar format that also mimics Disney's Country Bears. Although the characters were never given proper names, their documented names and stage placements are as follows:

####  Outer Stage Right #### 

* Western Monkey on Washboard
* Old Captain Bear

####  Inner Stage Right #### 

* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Armstrong Louis Armstrong] Monkey
* Showmaster Monkey & Bird

####  Center Stage #### 

* Gorilla Pianist (Lift)
* Hawaiian Monkey Trio (Lift)
* Saxophone Monkey
* Upright Bass Monkey
* Banjo Monkey
* Drummer Monkey
* Violin Monkey
* Accordion Monkey
* Bavarian Parrot (Off-Stage)
* French Parrot (Off-Stage)

####  Inner Stage Left #### 

* Bonvivant Monkey
* '[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Save_Your_Kisses_for_Me Kisses For Me]' Monkey Trio

####  Outer Stage Left #### 

* Primadonna Monkey
* Drunken Bear with Lantern

The original soundtrack for Die Klimbimski-Show was never released in its entirety. [https://youtu.be/rDYMbNy3e9c?si=EoPl-OuvQiKub428 A vinyl LP released by Phantasialand] shortly after the show's premiere only included four songs from the soundtrack, individually performed by the Bonvivant Monkey, Hawaiian Monkey Trio, and Drunken Bear, with the show's finale (set to the tune of When the Saints Go Marching In) tagged on at the end of Side A. The record's Side B, meanwhile, was entirely dedicated to '[https://youtu.be/Z-Uv-QCe6bs?si=A_Fb-X0TUdI4KpVr Das Phantasialand-Lied],' the park's theme song at the time. Reinhard Hofmann has confirmed the soundtrack's original reels to be in storage at Hofmann Figuren, but have yet to be digitized and approved by Phantasialand for public release.

###  Avonturenpark Hellendoorn (1989-2003) ### 
By 1983, Phantasialand sought for a replacement of Die Klimbimski-Show to install within the Scala theater, which arrived in the form of Hofmann's [[Phantasialand Starparade]] three years later in 1986. When the Klimbimski-Show was removed from Phantasialand, all of the animatronics and stage pieces were sent back to Hofmann and were left unused in their facilities for several years. The show would then be purchased by [https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avonturenpark_Hellendoorn Avonturenpark Hellendoorn] in the Netherlands, leading to a complete refurbishment, reconfiguration, and relocation to the Dutch park for the 1989 season. Similarly to Phantasialand, an all-new building was constructed to house the show, replacing the park's original Autoscooter attraction, named the Broadway Theater. The newly-renamed **_Hellendoorn Magical Monkey Show**_, premiered on March 29th, 1989 with Dutch comedian and actor, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_van_Duin André van Duin], in attendance. Dutch chocolate milk brand, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chocomel Chocomel], sponsored the Magical Monkey Show in its initial year.

Although the animatronics and stage design were unchanged overall, some characters were either removed or modified. Hellendoorn's mascot, the Pirate Parrot, was added to the show as an all-new animatronic, leading to the removal of the Bavarian and French parrots. Center Stage and some side stages were given painted backdrops appropriate to their respective characters (though not every character was given these painted backdrops). The Old Captain Bear was redressed to become a cowboy character, while the Kisses for Me Monkey Trio were also redressed to seemingly resemble that of female flight attendants. Some characters were repositioned from their original placements on stage, which are as follows:

####  Right Balcony #### 

* Pirate Parrot

####  Outer Stage Right #### 

* 'Kisses For Me' Monkey Trio
* Western Monkey on Washboard

####  Inner Stage Right #### 

* Showmaster Monkey & Bird
* Louis Armstrong Monkey

####  Center Stage #### 

* Gorilla Pianist (Lift)
* Hawaiian Monkey Trio (Lift)
* Saxophone Monkey
* Upright Bass Monkey
* Drummer Monkey
* Accordion Monkey
* Banjo Monkey
* Violin Monkey

####  Inner Stage Left #### 

* Primadonna Monkey
* Drunken Bear with Lantern

####  Outer Stage Left #### 

* Bonvivant Monkey
* Cowboy (Old Captain) Bear

The Dutch soundtrack for the Magical Monkey Show was produced exclusively for Hellendoorn, with an all-new script written by [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willem_Wilmink Willem Wilmink], a famous poet and writer in the Netherlands. The Dutch soundtrack has a runtime of about 15 minutes, approximately half of the estimated duration for the German Klimbimski-Show soundtrack. Unlike Phantasialand, Hellendoorn released [https://youtu.be/9kWrXEFSOO4?si=lfM8WnFsxUo9RzkS the complete soundtrack to the Magical Monkey Show on audio-cassette], which had been digitized and uploaded to YouTube by Pretparknostalgie with permission from Avonturenpark Hellendoorn on November 10th, 2023 (20 years since the closure of the attraction at Hellendoorn).

While the Hellendoorn Magical Monkey Show was a success, Dutch park-goers found the attraction to be 'repetitive' after viewing more than once. Popularity of the Magical Monkey Show diminished by the early 2000's, in conjunction with maintenance costs to operate the show. As a result, the decision was made by Hellendoorn to close the Magical Monkey Show at the end of the 2003 season, gutting the stage and animatronics in favor of live performances inside the redesigned 'Golden Palace Theater.' The existence of the animatronics past 2003 have been unconfirmed, though some sources claim the animatronics were destroyed upon the attraction's closure. Few remnants of the Magical Monkey Show have remained, despite this, as the pirate parrot's balcony remains in its original spot on the left side wall (albeit empty). One side stage proscenium was kept intact, repainted, and installed above the entrance of the Golden Palace Theater as a tribute to the Magical Monkey Show.
