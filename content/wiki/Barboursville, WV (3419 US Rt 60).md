**_3419 US Rt 60**_ also known as **_Huntington**_ or **_East Barboursville**_ was a franchised Showbiz Pizza Place location that opened sometime between 1983-1986, and closed as a Showbiz Pizza Place in 1988 (month and day unknown). This location was owned by Rex Donahue, who owned every Showbiz Pizza location in the state of West Virginia. This location is also notable for being the very first [Billy Bob's Wonderland]({{< ref "wiki/Billy Bob's Wonderland.md" >}}){< ref "wiki/Billy Bob's Wonderland.md" >}}) store, being one after leaving the brand.

## History ##
### Showbiz Pizza Era (Mid 1980s-1988) ###
Barboursville had it's grand opening in the early-mid 1980s. The store had everything a normal Showbiz had, which was wood paneling, arcade games, play places, dining rooms, and they had the Rock-afire [Classic Stage]({{< ref "wiki/Classic Stage.md" >}}){< ref "wiki/Classic Stage.md" >}}) as well. No footage has been found of Barboursville as a Showbiz Pizza Place, but photos do exist.
### Billy Bob's Wonderland Era (1988-2003) ###
In 1988, it was announced that [Concept Unification]({{< ref "wiki/Concept Unification.md" >}}) would take place, which involved the conversion of all Showbiz stores to Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza. Rex Donahue would make the decision then after to defranchising the location, making it independent. The store would then become the very first [Billy Bob's Wonderland]({{< ref "wiki/Billy Bob's Wonderland.md" >}}) location, with Ashland, KY opening a while later. The bots would be taken to the new store, and used for parts with Ashland, KY, and Parkersburg, WV.

In 2003, Billy Bob's Wonderland would permanently close along with Ashland, KY, so they could form a larger, more dedicated store on .
### Post-BBWL Era (2003-Present) ###
After the store closed, the space would remain vacant for a while, until they were cut in half and filled up by American restaurant company Famous Dave's. Famous Dave's would close in 2010, and the other side would become Plato's Closet. As of April 2023, Victorian Finance and Plato's Closet remain open to this day.
