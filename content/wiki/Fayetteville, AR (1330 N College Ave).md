##History##
Fayetteville opened its doors on November 1st, 1982 as the last Showbiz Pizza store in Pennsylvania. Like many other ShowBiz Pizza locations, it had a typical SPP layout as seen in many other stores across the United States and would eventually receive the 1988 remodel years after it would open removing older SPP decor for newer decor, and slight exterior remodel. Although some little documentation exists back in the ShowBiz days, it can be determined that Fayetteville was one of several locations to receive an Uncle Klunk show package (and a Santa Claus retrofit package as well) sometime after opening. Like many ShowBiz locations in the late 1980s, Fayetteville received the Showbiz Pizza Campground upgrade. On October 1st, 1990, Fayetteville was acquired by the Corporate along with . Fayetteville then underwent Concept Unification in around 1991, converting the Rock-Afire Explosion into Munch's Make Believe Band.
