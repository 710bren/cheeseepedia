<h2> Trivia: </h2>

* It's Showtime! bumper which was introduced back in 1988, along with the Cyberstar Intro retires in favor for the new animated intro for CEC-TV debuting in <a href="{{< ref "wiki/CEC Future" >}}">CEC Future</a>.
* Chuck E's Place would be reused in the future starting with the live show Land of 1000 Dances 1991, and most famously Havin' A Party in 1992.
* The intermission music is the same as <a href="{{< ref "wiki/SPP Best Of 2" >}}">SPP Best Of 2</a> (except it excluded a couple songs for that show).
