<p><b><i>Mumbai, India</b> (<b>R City Mall, 1st Floor, Lal Bahadur Shastri Rd, next to Pantaloons (R City Mall, Mumbai, Maharastra))</b></i> was a Chuck E. Cheese that opened on December 20, 2019, with a Dance Floor, and closed on July 25th, 2023.<sup>[1]</sup> On Instagram, DMs have suggested that there have been plans to relocate Chuck E. Cheese to another store.</p>
<p>This location was the very first location in the country of India and was also the last store to open in 2019, and the 2010's decade.</p>

<p>As the store was a 2.0, it had a Dance Floor, it is the 2019 Model, and they did not have the Video Wall.</p>
