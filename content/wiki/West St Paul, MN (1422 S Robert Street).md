This  location opened up in May 1983 (day unknown) as a Showbiz Pizza and Closed on December 31st 2019 As a Chuck E Cheese's.

 It opened up in May 1983 with the Rock a fire classic stage and remained like that until 1988 when it went through the 1988 Remodel which included new rock a fire artwork. Unfortunately, there's no videos as West St Paul as a Showbiz. West St Paul Remained like this until 1991 when they received concept unification. They also got the 1988 remodel. In 1994, West St Paul received the 1993 Remodel removing the original concept unification artwork. West St Paul Remained like this until 1999, when the 3 Stage was removed and replaced with a unique Studio C Alpha. They also received the 1999 Remodel. Which they had it for the rest of the stores life. West St Paul Remained like this until 2006/2007 when the received the 2005 Remodel (interior only) and removed the Showroom walls. They remained like this until December 31st 2019, when they would close for unknown reasons. Not to long after, it was changed into a AutoZone, which is still in the space.
