They opened with with the RockAfire Explosion like every other ShowBiz did. Like many other ShowBiz locations, it had a typical SPP layout seen in many other stores across the United States. After just under three years of operation, the store shut down in October 13th, 1985. After the store closed, the show was sent to [\2](\1) to replace their original animatronics which they had for four years (This was also the show they used for [[Concept Unification]]).
