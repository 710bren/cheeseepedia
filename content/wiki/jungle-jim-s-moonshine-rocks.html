Over the past 40 years Jungle Jim's has had various props from the Rock Afire Explosion installed at various places. Some of those being Moonshine jugs, Rocks & Rolfe's Rainbow. These were all located at <i>Jungle Jim's International Market</i> in Cincinnati, Ohio. (5440 Dixie Hwy, Fairfield, OH 45014) at one time.
<h2> Moonshine Jug History </h2>

Then in 2018 the display originally from the Premium Cigars section was trashed which included the Moonshine jugs ending the 30 year history.
