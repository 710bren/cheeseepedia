<b>Kooser Jasper T. Jowls</b> was the upgraded Winchester Jasper T. Jowls (Animatronic) (Portrait Jasper) used at the opening of the [San Jose, CA (1371 Kooser Road)]({{< ref "wiki/San Jose, CA (1371 Kooser Rd).md" >}}) Pizza Time Theatre in December 1978. It was used until May 1980, when the Portrait Show would be replaced by the [Balcony Stage.]({{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage.md" >}})

<h2>History</h2>
After Kooser replaced their Portrait Show with the Balcony Stage, Jasper and the other Portrait Bots, aside from Chuck E, which we have confirmation of, were presumably sent to [Sunnyvale]({{< ref "wiki/Pizza Time Theatre Sunnyvale, CA Corporate Office.md" >}}). After PTT vacated the building due to bankruptcy, Jasper would, along with the rest of Kooser's animatronics would be considered lost, as none of their fates have been learned, although the most likely option is they were thrown away.
<h2>Design</h2>
Kooser Jasper, like the other Kooser animatronics, is the upgraded version of Winchester's version. His eyes are made round with metal eyelids as opposed to the flat design of Winchester's eyes with fabric eyelids. His face is made narrower and his body is made thinner.
