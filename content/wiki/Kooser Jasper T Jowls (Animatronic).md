[[File:Kooser Jasper.png|thumb]]
**Kooser Jasper T. Jowls** was the upgraded Winchester Jasper T. Jowls (Animatronic) (Portrait Jasper) used at the opening of the [San Jose, CA (1371 Kooser Road)]({{< ref "wiki/San Jose, CA (1371 Kooser Rd).md" >}}) Pizza Time Theatre in December 1978. It was used until May 1980, when the Portrait Show would be replaced by the [Balcony Stage.]({{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage.md" >}})

## Design ##
Kooser Jasper, like the other Kooser animatronics, is the upgraded version of Winchester's version. His eyes are made round with metal eyelids as opposed to the flat design of Winchester's eyes with fabric eyelids. His face is made more narrow and his body is made thinner. 

### Movements ###

## Fate ##
After Kooser upgraded to the Balcony show, Jasper's whereabouts were unknown. It's assumed he was moved to [Sunnyvale]({{< ref "wiki/Pizza Time Theatre Sunnyvale, CA Corporate Office.md" >}}), but unlike Kooser Chuck E. Cheese (Animatronic) (Chuck E), there are no pictures of him at Sunnyvale. He is currently presumed to have been destroyed when Sunnyvale relocated to [Texas]({{< ref "wiki/Showbiz Pizza Time Corporate Office.md" >}}) after PTT's bankruptcy.,
