<b><i>Smile America. Spell Chuck E Cheese</b></i> was a sweepstakes promotion game that ran at select [Pizza Time Theatre]({{< ref "wiki/Pizza Time Theatre.md" >}}) locations from June 6th to August 15th of 1983.<ref name=':0'>https:<i>www.newspapers.com/image/899994060/?clipping_id=115040355&fcfToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJmcmVlLXZpZXctaWQiOjg5OTk5NDA2MCwiaWF0IjoxNjcxNzU5Nzg4LCJleHAiOjE2NzE4NDYxODh9.Y7TKj4VSVA9bK1l-oRkL7v5lYxGrz-IT1nq0BiXcAIM&terms=spell&match=1</ref><ref name=':1'>https:</i>archive.org/details/the-pizza-times-newsletters/1983%20The%20Pizza%20Times%203-2/page/6/mode/2up?q=sweepstakes</ref>

<h2>Sweepstakes</h2>
Upon visiting a location and requesting, guests are given a game sheet and a random game piece with a letter on it. Guests are encouraged to continue to return and collect game pieces to eventually spell one of the Pizza Time Players' names on the sheet, similar to Bingo. Winners would receive one of many various prizes, including cash up to $10,000.

No purchase was necessary to participate, though later in July 1983 a coupon would be run implying a potential change to required purchase for the rest of the event<ref name=':2'>https://www.newspapers.com/search/?query=%22Smile%20America%20Spell%20Chuck%20E%20Cheese%22</ref>. The event may have also been extended to August 30th at this point<ref name=':2' />.
<h2>=Names</h2>=
The game sheet had multiple names that could be spelled to win. This is implied to be the main five characters, though it is unclear if other side characters and lounge/cabaret characters were included.

It is also unknown the exact depictions of the names on the sheet needed to spell a character outside the confirmed 'Chuck E Cheese'. Shorter names like <i>Mr. Munch</i> were likely kept in full, but longer ones like <i>Jasper T. Jowls</i> may have had the middle initial removed.
<h2>=Prizes</h2>=
The prizes totaled $10 Million to be given away, though it is unclear which prizes had multiple offerings. It is unknown who were the winners of the main prizes after the event ended.
