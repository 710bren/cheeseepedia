<b><i>4631 Commercial Dr</b></i> was a <i>Chuck E. Cheese's</i> that opened on October 30, 2006 with a [Studio C Cappa]({{< ref "wiki/Studio C Cappa.html" >}}), which closed in June 2020 during a wave of closures due to the company's bankruptcy.

This location is not to be confused with the <i>Pizza Time Theatre</i> location, [New Hartford / Utica, NY (8555 Seneca Turnpike)]({{< ref "wiki/New Hartford  Utica, NY (8555 Seneca Turnpike).html" >}}), which was open from 1982-1985. 

<h2> Stages </h2>
The location opened with the 'V3' variant of the [Studio C Cappa]({{< ref "wiki/Studio C Cappa.html" >}}). The stage remained intact until the location's closure.

The animatronic had its eyebrows and hat removed at some point during its history.
