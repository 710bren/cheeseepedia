<p><b><i>4631 Commercial Dr</b></i> was a <i>Chuck E. Cheese's</i> that opened on October 30, 2006 with a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Studio C Cappa" >}}">Studio C Cappa</a>, which closed in June 2020 during a wave of closures due to the company's bankruptcy.</p>
<p>This location is not to be confused with the <i>Pizza Time Theatre</i> location, <a href="{{< ref "wiki/New Hartford  Utica, NY (8555 Seneca Turnpike)" >}}">New Hartford / Utica, NY (8555 Seneca Turnpike)</a>, which was open from 1982-1985.</p>
<p><h2> Stages </h2></p>
<p>The location opened with the 'V3' variant of the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Studio C Cappa" >}}">Studio C Cappa</a>. The stage remained intact until the location's closure.</p>
<p>The animatronic had its eyebrows and hat removed at some point during its history.</p>
