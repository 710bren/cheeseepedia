This location is located in the Castleton Point Shopping Center across from the Castleton Square Mall. They would receive Concept Unification in 1991 or 1992, and removed the 3-Stage in 2000 for a Studio C Alpha which was removed for a Dance Floor.
##History##
5501 E 82nd St opened on April 28th, 1982 and had a Rock-Afire Explosion like every other Showbiz. Around 1991, they would receive Concept Unification and receive the Concept Unification decor and a new exterior. In around the Mid 1990's, They would receive either [Phase 1]({{< ref "wiki/Phase 1 (1994).md" >}}) or [Phase 2]({{< ref "wiki/Phase 2 (1997).md" >}}) which added a lot of 1990s decor and assets such as the Record Posters and Colored Chase Lights.  In the year 2000, they received the Phase 3 remodel which marked the end of the 3-Stage. It was replaced by the Studio C Alpha and got a new exterior and most of the early 90s decor was removed and the late 90's and 2000's decor and SkyTubes were added. Somewhere between 2008 or 2009, it would undergo the 2005 remodel which involved the exterior, the removal of the early 2000's posters, and the new decor. In October 2018, they would undergo the 2.0 remodel removing the Alpha for the Dance Floor.
##Stages##
