The **2-Stage** is a stage format found at [Chuck E. Cheese's]({{< ref "wiki/Chuck E Cheese's.md" >}}) locations that either opened with the stage or replaced a previous stage from 1992 to 1997. It was the first Cyberamic stage to give all the characters legs, the Rocker Stage had Chuck E., Helen, and Jasper with legs, but Munch and Pasqually were still half-bodied. As of September 2022, there are 21 2-Stages in the United States and Canada.
