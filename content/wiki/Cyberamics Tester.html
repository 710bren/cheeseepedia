The <b><i>Cyberamics Tester</b></i> was a diagnostic unit used in the early days of the  [Cyberamics]({{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics.html" >}}) that allowed individual testing of each bit of a character card.

<h2> Description </h2>
The unit would presumably bypass the [Cyberamic Control System]({{< ref "wiki/Cyberamic Control System.html" >}}), having the character card plug directly into it, and having its outputs go straight to the solenoid board of the character. Due to the solenoid board being directly on the animatronic, the tester likely had to climb directly onto the stage and test the movements right next to the character. An audio out port exists on the top of the machine, it is unclear what this was used for.

<h2> Production / Usage </h2>
The machine was likely produced up until the Cyberamic Diagnostics Tape was released, which provided a faster option for stores to diagnose characters, though it could have still been used for prolonged diagnostics of a singular character.

Two versions of the unit are known, one with black printed labels and the <i>Audio Out</i> port in the center, and one with white labels and the port shifted to the right. It is currently unknown which variant is the revision.
