<h2>Trivia:</h2>

*Happy Birthday, Helen reuses Dialogue from 'Gamin' Time' when she says 'Thanks, Chuck E.'
*'In The Future' is originally from Chuck E. Cheese's Show 2 2015 (Show 2 2015), 'Nobody Knows' is originally from [Summer 2014]({{< ref "wiki/July 2014 Show.md" >}}), 'Arizona' is originally from [Summer 2014]({{< ref "wiki/July 2014 Show.md" >}}), 'Gamin' Time' is originally from Chuck E. Cheese's Show 3 2016 (Show 3 2016), and 'Party With You' is originally from Chuck E. Cheese's Winter 2015 (Winter 2015)
*'Gamin' Time' was re-released for this show but with text added onto the screen stating 'We are celebrating Helen's birthday!' after that for the rest of the song giving facts about Helen's Life. Here are now all the facts shown on the video. 'Helen Henny was born May 27th and grew up in New York City', 'Helen is a serious gamer!', 'Years ago, Helen met Chuck E. in a arcade and challenged him to a Pong tournament', 'Helen ultimately won that day, earning Chuck E.'s respect.', 'She then broke into a victory song.', 'When it came for Chuck E. to add a singer to his band, guess who he called?!', and last 'Helen has 2 brothers named Henry & Harvey'. Once the song is over the text 'Happy Birthday, Helen Henny' Shows up on screen.

* 'Party With You' was slightly re-edited to add 'The Chuck E. Cheese Show' intro originally from 'Friendship Never Ends' due to the Act format that was originally used with Chuck E. Cheese's Winter 2015 (Winter 2015). 
*On the Newsletter for Show 4 2016 'Arizona' was forgotten on the news letter between 'Caspar Babypants - 'I Found You' and 'Sigala - 'Easy Love'
* 'Happy Dance' was reprogrammed but for Weigl based stores. 
* 'In The Future' was reprogrammed which was adding more movements to the original programming and redoing all the lighting.
