{{Showtape|date=June 1987}}

**The Yogi Bear Showtape** was a showtape that ran in three Showbiz Pizza Place locations (Omaha, NE, Colorado Springs, CO, and Augusta, GA) in June 1987 as part of a test to bring licensed characters to Showbiz Pizza in the hopes to eventually phase The Rock Afire Explosion out of restaurants. 

## Discovery ##
After the limited run of The Yogi Bear Stage, the showtape was presumed lost due to its short run in stores, and only running in three stores. The showtape’s audio was revealed in August 2020  by Steve White, who had produced the show and was uploaded to YouTube by Showbizpizza.com.

## Showtape Summary ##
Segment one begins with Fatz asking the remaining Rock Afire Explosion members what they’ve never had before. After a few gueV\sses, it’s revealed they’ve never had a guest star before (Which is false due to Uncle Klunk having debuted in 1983), and the band performs _Who Can It Be Now?_ to build the anticipation. After the song, Yogi is introduced with the _Yogi Bear Theme Song_. Yogi’s curtains open and he introduces himself and his sidekick Boo Boo, who is afraid of Fatz. The band then performs _I’m So Excited_, with Yogi providing backup vocals. The segment ends with Boo Boo saying he’s excited, with Yogi agreeing as the song finishes.

Segment two begins with Yogi’s curtains opening early and him asking the patrons to share their pizza with him. Eventually Boo Boo and the rest of the band scold him for this, which prompts Yogi to sing _Hungry_. After the song, rest of the Rock Afire Explosion tell Yogi that Mr. Ranger is in the audience by describing parts of him (Medium, dark hair, park ranger hat and uniform), with Fatz explaining that Mr. Ranger would be dropping in to watch Yogi and that he requested the band to play _Every Breath You Take._

Segment three begins with Mitzi admitting she has a crush on one of the guest stars, refusing to elaborate before singing _Let’s Hear it for the Boy_. After the song, Yogi and Boo Boo discuss entertaining the guests out in the audience, before showing the Rock Afire Boo Boo’s soft-shoe routine, which leads to Fatz asking about bringing their act into the modern times, and Beach Bear singing _Rock and Roll Star_. Yogi closes the segment by saying “And I can rock and roll better than the average bear!”
