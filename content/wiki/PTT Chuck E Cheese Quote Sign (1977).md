Not to be confused with the Cheese Crawl Chuck Quote Sign, the **_Chuck E. Cheese Quote Sign**_ first appeared at the first Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre on [\2](\1) located in the Town & Country Shopping Center in San Jose, California. The sign would make another known appearance at the [\2](\1) located on 15511 Edwards Street located in Huntington Beach, California.  

##  Production ## 
No specific information about the production of the sign is known outside of speculation, we can assume it was made in-house at Atari and standardized once Pizza Time Theatre Incorporated was founded. 

##  Usage ## 
The only known usages of this fixture was 1 unit at [\2](\1) placed next to the beverage counter, most likely displaying text about the beverage options, and another unit at [\2](\1) most likely stating rules to the newly tested bumper car concept. This signage was most likely used at several other stores at the time, although we only know of 2.

##  Design ## 
Similarly to the Chuck E. Cheese Measuring Sign used for the Cheese Crawl, this sign showcases the Chuck E. Cheese character with a quote next to his head, making it seem like he's saying something, which could probably be changed depending on what it was needed for.
