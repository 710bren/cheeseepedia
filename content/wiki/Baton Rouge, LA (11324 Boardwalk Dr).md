<b><i>11324 Boardwalk Dr Store #609</b></i> was a <i>Showbiz Pizza/Chuck E. Cheese</i> that opened on August 12, 1981 as a corporate <i>ShowBiz Pizza Place</i> with a [Rock-Afire Explosion]({{< ref "wiki/Classic Stage.md" >}}). and closed on November 3, 2021 with a 3-Stage. It was the 25th Showbiz Pizza store to open and the 3rd in Louisiana.
<h2>History</h2>
This location opened its doors on August 12th, 1981 with a Rock-afire Explosion show. It was originally and formerly a corporate-owned store. It was the third Showbiz Pizza in the state of Louisiana. Like many other ShowBiz Pizza locations, it had a typical SPP layout seen in many other stores across the United States and would eventually receive the 1988 remodel years after it would open. Unfortunately, very little documentation exists back when it was a Showbiz Pizza.

In 1991, Baton Rouge received Concept Unification which converted the show to Munch's Make Believe Band removing the Rock-Afire Explosion for the 3-Stage, removal of all SPP decor, exterior change, and new decor. In around the Mid-Late 1990's, Baton Rouge received either [Phase 1]({{< ref "wiki/Phase 1 (1994).md" >}}) or [Phase 2]({{< ref "wiki/Phase 2 (1997).md" >}}) remodel which removed some early 90's decor and added new decor and SkyTubes. Baton Rouge remained this way until in 2010 when they received the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative and also expanded. They would remain like this until their closure on November 3rd, 2021 due to multiple issues and Covid-19. On August 28th, 2023, the site of the store would be bought by a Circle K next door for $1 million to make way for its expansion.<ref>https://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/business/circle-k-buys-former-chuck-e-cheese-location-for-1-million/article_e8b2e3ca-45b7-11ee-98d4-936420e01fb3.html</ref> The store would later be demolished by the end of the year for the Circle K's expansion remodel, which is how it sits to this day under construction.
<h2>Stages</h2>
Baton Rouge opened with the Rock afire Explosion in August 1981. Unfortunately, there are hardly any photos or videos to exist of Baton Rouge as a Showbiz Pizza. There are Phase 3 and 4 photos, but not Phase 2 (post-CU) or Showbiz Pizza.

In 1991, Baton Rouge received [Concept Unification]({{< ref "wiki/Concept Unification.md" >}}), converting the Rock afire into Munchâ€™s Make Believe Band.

In 2010, Baton Rouge received an exterior remodel.

In November 2021, the location closed due to COVID-19.
