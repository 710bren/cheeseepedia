## History## 
Baton Rouge opened its doors on August 12th, 1981 with a Rock-afire Explosion show. It was originally and formerly a corporate-owned store. It is the third Showbiz Pizza in the state of Louisiana. Like many other ShowBiz Pizza locations, it had a typical SPP layout seen in many other stores across the United States and would eventually receive the 1988 remodel years after it would open. Unfortunately, very little documentation exists back when it was a Showbiz Pizza.

In 1991, Baton Rouge received Concept Unification which converted the show to Munch's Make Believe Band removing the Rock-Afire Explosion for the 3-Stage, removal of all SPP decor, exterior change, and new decor. In around the Mid-Late 1990's, Baton Rouge received either [https://chuckepedia.com/wiki/Phase_1_(1994) Phase 1] or [https://chuckepedia.com/wiki/Phase_2_(1997) Phase 2] remodel which removed some early 90's decor and added new decor and SkyTubes. Baton Rouge remained this way until in 2010 when they received the 2005 Remodel which involved removing the Showroom Walls, balcony Seating, received a new exterior and expanded. They would remain like this until their closure in November 3rd, 2021 due to multiple issues and Covid-19. They were demolished in 2022. As of February 2023, the space is now an empty land.
## Stages## 
Baton Rouge opened with the Rock afire Explosion in August 1981. Unfortunately, there are hardly any photos or videos to exist of Baton Rouge as a Showbiz Pizza. There are Phase 3 and 4 photos, but not Phase 2 (post-CU) or Showbiz Pizza.

In the 1990s, Baton Rouge received [https://chuckepedia.com/wiki/Concept_Unification Concept Unification], converting the Rock afire into Munchâ€™s Make Believe Band.
