##History##
This store opened on December 19th, 2001 with a Phase 3 Thumb Chuck logo over the door with the 'Chuck E. Cheese's' name directly below Chuck. The store opened with the classic Phase 3, featuring Must C TV's in the showroom, and props, posters, and magazines scattered throughout the store. 

In 2008, the store exterior signage was replaced with the Phase 4 thumb chuck signage. From then up until 2014, the store had slowly been removing pieces of art off the walls (Magazines, the Warhol pieces, props, etc.) A few months before the store's remodel, they were given purple walls in the showroom, and a the front counter area. By June 2018, the store  would begin its CEC 2018 2.0 Remodel Program (2.0 Remodel), removing the store's show by July 3rd.<ref>https://youtu.be/EzwCiJiHGas</ref> The grand re-opening event at Lake Charles was held on August 9th, 2018, with athlete Jennie Finch attending.
