The Chuck E. Cheese's in Lake Charles, Louisiana opened on **December, 19th, 2001.**


They opened with a Studio C Beta 1-Screen, which was removed in Summer 2018 as part of the Dance Floor Remodel

## History ##
Lake Charles opened on December 19th, 2001, and was store #709. The store opened with a Phase 3 Thumb Chuck logo over the door with the 'Chuck E. Cheese's' name directly below Chuck. 

The store opened with the classic Phase 3, featuring Must C TV's in the showroom, and props, posters, and magazines scattered throughout the store.


In 2008, the store exterior signage was replaced with the Phase 4 thumb chuck signage.


From then up until 2014, the store had slowly been removing pieces of art off the walls (Magazines, the Warhol pieces, props, etc.)


A few months before the store's remodel, they were given purple walls in the showroom, and a the front counter area.


The grand re-opening event at Lake Charles was held on August 9th, 2018, with athlete Jennie Finch attending.
