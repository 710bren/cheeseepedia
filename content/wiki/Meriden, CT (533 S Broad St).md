<b><i>533 S Broad St</b></i> was a <i>Chuck E. Cheese's</i> that opened on January 30, 2002 and closed on May 19, 2013 with a Studio C 2000 (Studio C Beta, 32m).

<h2> Stage </h2>
Meriden's only stage was a Studio C 2000 (Studio C Beta, 32m). Around 2009-2011, the curtains were disabled, and by 2011, Chuck received the Avenger shirt. The stage would remain like this until closure in 2013.

<h2> History </h2>
Meriden opened on January 30, 2002 with the [Phase 3]({{< ref "wiki/Phase 3 (2000).md" >}}) remodel and a Studio C Beta. Unfortunately, not much is known about this location, other than a few videos that were taken throughout Meriden's history. Meriden was left untouched until May 19, 2013, when they would permanently close due to leasing issues. The building sat vacant for a short period until it was gutted and was split up between a GMC shop and PetSmart. As of July 2023, they are still there.
