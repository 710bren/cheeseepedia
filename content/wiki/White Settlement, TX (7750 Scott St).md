**7750 Scott St** was a Showbiz Pizza Place that opened on December 29, 1982 with a [Rock-Afire Explosion]({{< ref "wiki/Classic Stage.md" >}}), which closed in 1985.

This location reopened as a Showbiz Pizza (with the CEC characters) on August 6, 1987 with a Cyberamics Rocker Stage (Rocker Stage), which closed on June 25, 2020 because of the COVID-19 Pandemic

## Stages ##
Originally when the store opened, they had a Rock-Afire Explosion, as all other Showbiz locations had, they would have this until 1985, when they would close for unknown reasons, the stage was reportedly sent to the [Showbiz Pizza Time Corporate Office]({{< ref "wiki/Showbiz Pizza Time Corporate Office.md" >}}) to be used to program RAE shows (when SPP was programming them, not CEI) and is still being used as a CU 1-Stage at the [Chuck E. Cheese's Corporate Office]({{< ref "wiki/Chuck E Cheese's Corporate Office.md" >}}). On August 6, 1987, the store would reopen as a Showbiz Pizza with a Rocker Stage, as the period when the store opened was during the time when CEC stores went by the name of Showbiz, despite not having the RAE, they were the 3rd Rocker Stage installed, after [Eau Claire, Wisconsin]({{< ref "wiki/Eau Claire, WI (2221 Eastridge Center).md" >}}), and [Arlington, Texas]({{< ref "wiki/Arlington, TX (2216 S Fielder Rd).md" >}}), as well as being the second modern CEC store to open. They would have the Rocker Stage for a short time until February 1992, when they would receive the very first 2-Stage, having a different design than the later 2-Stages, with the stages separated into two parts (later ones have just one stage with a TV separating Chuck E. and Helen) a blue valence, 3-Stage buildings, Jasper sitting on a vent from a 3-Stage, Munch having a Road Stage keyboard, and Pasqually keeping his PTT arm movements. They would have the 2-Stage until they closed on June 25, 2020, as part of CEC's Bankruptcy and the COVID-19 Pandemic.
