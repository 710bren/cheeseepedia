<b><i>PTT 1981 Update</b></i> was a remodel for Pizza Time Theatre locations. It was released in the summer of 1981.
<h2> History </h2>
In May 1981, it was announced that Pizza Time Theatre locations would be updating all of its existing registered trademarks along with announcing that San Francisco based, S&O Consultants<ref>https://www.showbizpizza.com/info/documents/ptt/ptt_pizzatimes1-1.pdf</ref> would be redesigning their logos, exteriors, d√©cor, and signage. This package would roll out to locations through the summer of 1981.

<h2> Design </h2>
This was the first major change of Pizza Time Theatre's branding. Store exteriors were redesigned to have more of an impact on the guest. The exterior has some theatrical elements, such as Marquee lights, Colors, and Material Choice.

The signs included in this package were rounded, rectangular signs. The borders are either white or red  and the inside being colored either Green, Blue, Red, or Black.
