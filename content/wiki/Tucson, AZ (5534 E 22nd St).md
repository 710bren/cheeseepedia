**_5534 E 22nd St**_ was a _Pizza Time Theatre_ in Tucson, Arizona that opened in July/August 1980 with a Cyberamics Portrait / Shelf Stage (Portrait Stage).  

This is not to be confused with the [Tucson, AZ (8616 E Broadway Blvd)]({{< ref "wiki/Tucson, AZ (8616 E Broadway Blvd).md" >}}) Pizza Time Theatre  that opened on May 4th, 1981 and closed in 1983 with a [Balcony Stage]({{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage.md" >}}). This is also not to be confused with the [Tucson, AZ (6130 E Speedway Blvd)]({{< ref "wiki/Tucson, AZ (6130 E Speedway Blvd).md" >}}) location which opened in April 1995 with a [1-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/1-Stage.md" >}}) and was relocated to [Tucson, AZ (6125 E Speedway Blvd)]({{< ref "wiki/Tucson, AZ (6125 E Speedway Blvd).md" >}}) with a [Circles of Light, 16m]({{< ref "wiki/Circles of Light.md" >}}) and still operates to this day.

##History##
The store would open in July/August 1980 in the _County Fair Shopping Center_ with a Portrait Stage.

This was also the first Chuck E. Cheese of any kind to open in Arizona.

Not much is known about the location other than the one photo of the store's Portrait Stage from a memorial website.

The store was then closed in 1987 for unknown reasons (though it may have been underperforming, a reason for many store closures around the same time) after operating for around 7 years. The show's fate is unknown.
