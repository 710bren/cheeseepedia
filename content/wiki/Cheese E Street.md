## Audio Tapes ##
Multiple audio tapes were used for the attraction. One singular audio tape, hosting 27 music tracks, would loop continuously inside the attraction. Another would play audio for the Cheese E. Street clock located on the exterior, inviting guests into the attraction. A third would play audio for the Cheese Factory portion, though this is unclear if this was exterior or interior audio.

### Outtakes ###
Four outtake tracks were found within the archive for the original audio tapes. These are:

* Sesame Street (Track ???)
* The Typewriter (Track ???)
* This Old Man (Track ???)
* The Waltzing Cat (Track ???)
