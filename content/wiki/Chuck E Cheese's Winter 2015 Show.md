##Trivia:##
* This was the final CEC showtape for the following:
** To use the act format originally introduced in Summer 2014.
** To feature Mike Manly, Corby, Hard Hat Hank and Zoey, though the latter two through reused material.
** To use Mike Wolf's original puppet, as well as his last appearance before Show 2, 2020.
** To have a Hard Hat Hank intermission. 
* Winter 2015 was originally run until February 22nd 2015 but was extended till March 15th 2015.
* The Show Breaks in this show are originally from Summer 2014.
* Hard Hat Hank - 'Box' is also originally from Summer 2014.
* During Act 3 when scenes feature Chuck E. Cheese you can see the Pizza Time Theater logo on his shirt.
* Mike Wolf & Corby were originally seen during September 2014 during flash back with Justin Beaver.
* This show was originally planned to include six songs like most shows since April 2013, the latter two would've been covers. However, following the entertainment department's budget cut after the cat video lawsuit they were removed leaving the show with only four songs. This would've included Helen singing a new version of 'Crazy' from January 2008 and the other cover currently unknown.
