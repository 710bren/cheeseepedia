<h2>Trivia</h2><ul><li>The song's audio has been found, but is missing the initial announcer voice and countdown. Only a single second of the tape video has been found, as it was used in the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/May 1998 Show" >}}">May 1998 Show</a> during Segment 2. It is believed that parts from the August 1996 show used bluescreen footage from Strike It Up. Signals are also missing for this show.</li></ul>
