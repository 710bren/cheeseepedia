After Pizza Time Theatre vacated the Sunnyvale building in 1984, Jasper, along with Winchester's Winchester Chuck E. Cheese V2 (Animatronic) (Chuck E. Cheese (V2) Bot) and [Pasqually Bot]({{< ref "wiki/Winchester Pasqually (Animatronic).md" >}}) would be rescued by Jul Kamen. Jul would end up loaning all three portrait bots to the [SPT Headquarters]({{< ref "wiki/Showbiz Pizza Time Corporate Office.md" >}}) in the mid 1990's to display in a museum dedicated to the history of Chuck E. Cheese's. The museum plans would never go through and the animatronics would simply be used as display pieces.

At some point, Jasper's shirt was replaced with a blue and white striped shirt and their muzzle was repainted with extra spots.

The person who destroyed them is unknown.
