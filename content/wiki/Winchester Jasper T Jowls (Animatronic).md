Winchester Jasper T. Jowls was an animatronic featured at the [San Jose Pizza Time Theater]({{< ref "wiki/San Jose, CA (370 S Winchester Blvd).md" >}}). It would be used from the location's opening until it was replaced by the standard Cyberamic model in 1980.

## History ##

### Winchester ###
Jasper debuted with the rest of the Winchester animatronics on May 17, 1977. It was the first animatronic to be able to turn it's head, as it was a fully three-dimensional figure, as opposed to Winchester Chuck E. Cheese V1 (Animatronic) (Chuck E. Cheese) and Crusty the Cat. 

### Corporate Move and Destruction ###
After being replaced by the upgraded Cyberamic, Jasper was owned by Jul Kamen, along with V2 Chuck E. Cheese and V1 Pasqually. In the 90s, all three were loaned to CEC Headquarters. The plan was to feature the Winchester animatronics in a museum about the history of Chuck E. Cheese's. The museum plans never moved forward, and the bots were simply used as a display piece. According to fans, there were plans to make the animatronics move, but this never went anywhere either. 


In 2004, Headquarters went through a remodel, and the portrait bots were removed. While Chuck E. Cheese was rescued by employees, Jasper and Pasqually were destroyed.
