<b><i>3501-131 Capital Blvd, Store #635</b></i> is a Chuck E. Cheese located in Raleigh, North Carolina.

This location opened as a ShowBiz Pizza Place sometime in June 1988 (Day not yet found) as a franchised location and is still open today as a corporate owned store with a 2019 model Dance Floor and Video Wall. This store is also one of two Chuck E. Cheese stores located in the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_Triangle Research Triangle], the other being the [Mayfair St]({{< ref "wiki/Durham, NC (3724 Mayfair St).md" >}}) location in Durham, which opened on March 7, 1994 with a [1-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/1-Stage.md" >}}).

<h2>History</h2>

<h2>=ShowBiz Pizza Era (1988-1991)</h2>=
The shopping plaza that this location is part of, the Emporium Plaza, was originally built in 1987 and was at first named Drug Emporium Plaza, until being changed to its current name in 1992. It has been known as the Emporium Plaza since then for over 31 years.

For the Raleigh location itself, it originally began life as a ShowBiz Pizza Place in June 1988 with the [Rock-afire Explosion]({{< ref "wiki/Classic Stage.md" >}}) which was from the [Milwaukee, WI (7401 Good Hope Rd)]({{< ref "wiki/Milwaukee, WI (7401 Good Hope Rd).md" >}}) location. They opened with the 1988 update to the 1986 SPT Remodel Program. Raleigh was one of three Showbiz locations to open with the Rock-afire Explosion after the 1985-1986 Pizza Time Theatre and ShowBiz Pizza Place merger, along with Fort Smith, Arkansas (now 2.0), which also opened in 1988, and Richmond, Virginia (now 2.0), which opened on May 1, 1990 and was the last SPP location to open with the Rock-afire Explosion.

It is unknown if Raleigh kept any beta elements from Milwaukee, or if they recieved more finalized props for the show installation, as no photos or videos of the store with its RAE have been found yet.

<h2>=Tux Chuck Era and Cool Chuck Era (1991-2006) </h2>=
In 1991, Raleigh underwent Concept Unification just like several other locations that year. They kept the 1988 remodel, and their Rock-afire was replaced with Munch's Make-Believe Band, consisting of all the typical fixings of the time, including Chuck E's tuxedo outfit and latex masks for all characters. Raleigh was one of the few known locations to keep Billy Bob's guitar after the transition, and it was used presumably until sometime in the 90s, when it was replaced with a standard Beach Bear guitar. This remodel would also involve the removal of elements from the 1988 Remodel, such as the blue and white awnings, checkers on the walls around the store, and neon lights. A few years later, the store received the Phase 2 game package. By 2003, Chuck, Helen, and Munch had their latex masks replaced with plastic masks, with Jasper and Pasqually following in the coming years. It is likely Chuck never received the Cool Chuck outfit due to still having his tux in 2003 and kept it until it was replaced with the Avenger outfit.

On June 28, 2004, this store along with [Greensboro, NC (702-A Pembroke Rd)]({{< ref "wiki/Greensboro, NC (702-A Pembroke Rd).md" >}}) were bought out by Corporate (Making [Fayetteville, NC (511 North McPherson Church Rd)]({{< ref "wiki/Fayetteville, NC (511 North McPherson Church Rd).md" >}}) & Wilmington NC (4389 Oleander Dr) (Wilmington, NC (4389 Oleander Dr)) the last franchised locations in the state of North Carolina).

<h2>=Avenger Era (2006-2013)</h2>=
Around presumably mid/late 2005, the store received the 2005 update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative. Around this time, Chuck received the full Avenger outfit. By the end of the decade, Jasper & Pasqually also got plastic masks. Munch Jr. & Pizzacam were removed by the end of the decade as well (yet again, making Wilmington the last full 3-Stage in North Carolina).

<h2>=Rockstar Era-Present Day (2013-present)</h2>=
Prior to removal, Raleigh had a typical 3-Stage, with no prop characters. The first thing to happen to Raleigh's 3-Stage in the Rockstar era was in the year 2013, when Chuck's Avenger hat was removed during the mandatory hat removal of 2013, like with most other CEC locations that had animatronics at the time. Chuck received the Rockstar shirt around 2017, while retaining the Avenger shorts. This is how Chuck would look until the stage's removal. The Munch's Make Believe Band sign behind Munch was removed sometime in 2017 for unknown reasons. The stage was in relatively good condition before its removal, with Helen and Jasper being in almost perfect shape, although dipping a bit right before removal.

In August 2022, the store started its 2017 2.0 Remodel Program (2.0 remodel) which involved the removal of the 3-Stage for a Dance Floor & Video Wall. On the morning of Monday, August 30, 2022, the stage would be removed after 34 years in operation, and 41 years overall (since Milwaukee opened with their RAE 3-Stage in 1981). This made [Charlotte, NC (7701 Pineville-Matthews Rd)]({{< ref "wiki/Charlotte, NC (7701 Pineville-Matthews Rd).md" >}}) the last location to have 3-Stage in North Carolina and was one of the last two in the Carolinas along with [Columbia, SC (1775 Burning Tree Dr)]({{< ref "wiki/Columbia, SC (1775 Burning Tree Dr).md" >}}), before Columbia's was removed in November of 2022. As for what happened to Raleigh's stage, it was reportedly taken to a landfill after removal at 4 AM in the morning, marking of the end of Raleigh's 3-Stage. Work on their 2.0 remodel continued into the fall of 2022, and the store's Grand Reopening would take place on November 10th, 2022. In late spring 2024, Raleigh would install their Trampoline Zone, albeit with no character posters due to being placed by the windows. As of June 2024, they have the 2019 Dance Floor + Video Wall, the 2.0 remodel, and the Trampoline Zone.
