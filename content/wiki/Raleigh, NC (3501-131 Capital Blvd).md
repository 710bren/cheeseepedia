## History ##

### Showbiz ###
This store originally began as a Showbiz Pizza Place in June 1988 (Actual opening date not found yet) with The Rock-afire Explosion which was from the [Milwaukee, WI (7401 Good Hope Rd)]({{< ref "wiki/Milwaukee, WI (7401 Good Hope Rd).md" >}}) location. They opened with the 1988 remodel.

### Tux Chuck and Cool Chuck Eras ###
In around 1991, Raleigh underwent Concept Unification (Keeping the 1988 Remodel), and The Rock-afire was replaced by Munch's Make Believe Band, complete with all of the characters including extras such as Building, Moon, Wink, Pizzacam, and Munch Jr. Chuck E. wore his signature black tuxedo and red derby hat. By the Mid 1990's, the location recieved the Phase 1 Remodel. By 2003; Chuck E, Helen, & Munch had their Latex Masks replaced with Plastic ones. It is unknown of Chuck E at this location ever recieved the Cool Chuck outfit (He still had the Tuxedo & Derby back in 2003). On June 28 2004, this store along with [Greensboro, NC (702-A Pembroke Rd)]({{< ref "wiki/Greensboro, NC (702-A Pembroke Rd).md" >}}) were bought out by Corporate (Making [Fayetteville, NC (511 North McPherson Church Rd)]({{< ref "wiki/Fayetteville, NC (511 North McPherson Church Rd).md" >}}) & Wilmington NC (4389 Oleander Dr) the last two Franchised locations in the state of North Carolina).

### Avenger Era ###
In Around 2006-2007, the store recieved a Phase 4 Remodel.

By the end of the decade, Jasper & Pasqually also got plastic masks as well. 

Munch Jr & Pizzacam were removed by the end of the decade as well (yet atgain, making Wilmington the last full 3-Stage in North Carolina)

### Present Day ###
Raleigh features a 3-Stage without Prop Characters.

As of August 2022, the store is in the proccess of getting the 2.0 remodel which involves the removal of the 3-Stage for a Dance Floor & Video Wall. On Sunday, August 28 2022, the stage was removed.
