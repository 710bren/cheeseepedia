##Trivia##
*Three intermissions were originally planned to be on this show but were scrapped. The first was 'Hockey' which featured hockey footage with the instrumental of 'Dreamin_ from Chuck E Cheese April 2004 Show  ( April 2004). The second was a Coke Spot reused from [September 2004]({{< ref "wiki/September 2004.md" >}}). The third was 'Eliot Moose', another Funimation cartoon. These intermissions still appear on the Studio C DVD. 
*'Mailman' is a remake of a song from the [Working For A Living]({{< ref "wiki/Working For A Living.md" >}}). Robert Gotcher appears in the video, reprising his role as the mailman from the original.
* Eddie Coker's 'I Believe' is reused from [September 2001 Show]({{< ref "wiki/September 2001 Show.md" >}}). Countdown 2 and 3 are reused from [September 2004]({{< ref "wiki/September 2004.md" >}}).
*The Studio C puppets return to their regular backgrounds for this show, but the diagonal line is replaced with a cloud-like design similar to the [Just for Kids Show 2000]({{< ref "wiki/Just for Kids Show 2000.md" >}}).
*The Studio C puppets appear on-screen only during the dialogue portions, and when one of the other characters has a solo just like in [August 1999]({{< ref "wiki/August 1999.md" >}}). This includes:
**Jasper in 'Chores', ' All for You' and 'Ranchin_
**Munch in 'All for You' & 'Blue Suede Shoes'
**Helen in 'Wonderful' & 'Ranchin_
**Pasqually in 'Ranchin_
*'Football' reuses music from 'Closing Time?' from [September 2000 Show]({{< ref "wiki/September 2000 Show.md" >}}).
*The Winter 1-derland Spot is programmed on all versions of the show.
*Chuck's curtains close during 'Blue Suede Shoes' on all versions of the show.
*'Chores' is written by Matt Daniel.
