<h2>Trivia:</h2>
*The original artists behind 'I'm Shakin'', Rooney, visited a CEC location during the time this show was playing in order to hear their song being covered.<ref>https://youtu.be/wzM8V_eEpiY</ref>
*'Super Chuck E.' was originally a road show in 2005 though it has been slightly altered for this show.
*The CEC News intermission and most of the footage for 'Super Chuck E.' was reused from August 1997. They seem to have been taken from a master copy of the show as they are in much higher quality than the original show.
*Originally in segment 2, Chuck E. called former president George W. Bush. This was cut for an unknown reason.
*This show uses footage of the 3-Stage characters instead of the puppets on Studio C.
*This show was scripted by Duncan Brannan
