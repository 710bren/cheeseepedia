<p>The <b>Moon Animatronic</b> is an animatronic figure created by Creative Engineering Inc. for Showbiz Pizza Place locations from 1980-1983. It is a very simple figure, as its only movements are its raising from behind the backdrop and opening its mouth. Moon would later be used during <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Concept Unification Stage" >}}">Concept Unification</a>, where it would go unchanged.</p>
<p><h2> Movements </h2></p>
<p>Moon features 2 movements, being its head raise, and mouth.</p>
