**_253 Congaree Rd**_ was a _Showbiz Pizza Place_ that opened on February 8th, 1983 (date not confirmed yet) as a franchised location with a [https://chuckepedia.com/wiki/Classic_Stage Rock-Afire Explosion] and is still open to this very day.

It is located right across from the Haywood Mall.
##History##
Greenville opened its doors on February 8th, 1983 (not confirmed) as the second Showbiz Pizza store in South Carolina. Like many other ShowBiz Pizza locations, it had a typical SPP layout as seen in many other stores across the United States and would eventually receive the 1988 remodel years after it would open removing older SPP decor for newer decor, and a slight exterior remodel, and received the Showbiz Pizza Campground upgrade. Unfortunatly there is hardly any documentation of Greenville back then. In 1991, Greenville received Concept Unification removing all SPP decor for newer decor, added an exterior change, and removed the Rock-Afire Explosion band for the 3-Stage. In the early-mid 90's, Greenville underwent a minor remodel removing some decor for newer decor. On September 16th, 1996, Greenville was acquired by the Corporate along with Charleston, Columbia, and a few others. Around 1997 or 1998, the location received the so-called 'Phase 2' remodel removing older 90's decor, adding newer decor, another exterior change, and SkyTubes. Around 2000, their 3-Stage was removed for the Studio C Alpha. Greenville would remain like this until 2006-2007 when they received the 2005 remodel removing the Showroom Walls, Balcony Seating, removing older 2000's decor for newer decor, a new exterior change, and the relocation of the stage. Greenville remained like this until October 2018 when they received the 2.0 remodel, removing the Alpha for the Dance Floor. Strangely, the 2005 Remodel (Phase 4) sign was kept. Currently, as of February 2023, the location still has the 2.0 remodel and the Dance Floor.
##Stages##
Originally, Greenville featured a Rock-Afire Explosion, as all other Showbiz locations did. Unfortunately, there are no photos or videos to exist of Greenville with the Rock afire, or as a ShowBiz in general. they got Concept Unification sometime in 1991. In 2000, Greenville removed their 3-Stage for the Studio C Alpha. In October 2018, Greenville removed the Studio C Alpha for the Dance Floor for their 2.0 remodel.
