<b><i>Greenville, SC (253 Congaree Rd)</b></i> was a ShowBiz Pizza Place that opened in February 1983. It was the second ShowBiz to open in South Carolina and remains open as a Chuck E. Cheese's. Greenville is a free-standing store located right across from the Haywood Mall.

<h2>History</h2>
Greenville opened sometime in February 1983 as the second ShowBiz Pizza Place in South Carolina. The store was originally franchised, being owned and operated by the McBiz Corporation (along with 29 other locations). Like other ShowBiz locations, the store opened with a [Rock-afire Explosion]({{< ref "wiki/Classic Stage.md" >}}), placed adjacently on the store's rear wall. In the late 80's, Greenville underwent the [SPT 1988 Remodel Program]({{< ref "wiki/SPT 1988 Remodel Program.md" >}}), phasing out original ShowBiz Pizza Place decor and signage for that of generalized Showbiz Pizza Time assets.

Sometime in 1991, the location received [Concept Unification]({{< ref "wiki/Concept Unification Stage.md" >}}), retrofitting the Rock-afire into Munch's Make Believe Band, meanwhile keeping the ShowBiz Pizza name until later that same year. On September 16, 1996, Greenville's operating license was acquired by SPT Corporate along with sister locations [South Charleston]({{< ref "wiki/Charleston, SC (1610 Sam Rittenburg Blvd).md" >}}) & [Columbia]({{< ref "wiki/Columbia, SC (1775 Burning Tree Dr).md" >}}). Around this time, the store would undergo the [SPT 1992 Remodel Program]({{< ref "wiki/SPT 1992 Remodel Program.md" >}}).

The store received the ['Cool Chuck' Major Remodel Initiative]({{< ref "wiki/CEC 2005 Remodel Program.md" >}}) in the late 2000's, with newer booths, posters, and purple walls. Aside from rotating game packages, Greenville would remain in this state throughout the late 2000's into the 2010's decade. Between September and November 2018, Greenville underwent the [CEC 2018 2.0 Remodel Program]({{< ref "wiki/CEC 2018 20 Remodel Program.md" >}}), with infrastructure overhauled and the Studio C Alpha removed. A grand reopening for the store was held on December 5th, 2018. The 2.0. Remodel has been the current iteration of Greenville ever since. 

<h2>Stages</h2>
Greenville would premiere with a Classic Rock-afire Explosion, as other ShowBiz locations did at the time. The show would remain largely unchanged until 1991, when [Concept Unification]({{< ref "wiki/Concept Unification.md" >}}) occurred. The Munch's Make Believe Band 3-Stage would then be replaced by a Studio C Alpha in the year 2000, operating until Greenville's 2.0. remodel in October 2018.
