The **Choo Choo Animatronic** is an animatronic figure created by Creative Engineering Inc. for Showbiz Pizza Place locations from 1980-1983

It is an extremely simple figure, as its only movement is raising up from his tree stump. Choo Choo would later be used in the [Concept Unification Stage]({{< ref "wiki/Concept Unification Stage.md" >}}),aka, the 3-Stage, where it would be changed into Junior Munch, otherwise known as Munch Jr., who was a little version of Mr. Munch with a propeller cap. Munch Jr. went extinct when the Wilmington, North Carolina location closed in October of 2020.
