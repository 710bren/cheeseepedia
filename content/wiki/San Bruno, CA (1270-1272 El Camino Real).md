<h2> History </h2>
San Bruno opened on May 30, 1994 with the SPT 1992/1993 Remodel Program and [1-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/1-Stage.md" >}}). We don’t know when they received the [Phase I]({{< ref "wiki/Phase 1 (1994).md" >}}), [Phase II]({{< ref "wiki/Phase 2 (1997).md" >}}), and [Phase III]({{< ref "wiki/Phase 3 (2000).md" >}}) game packages, but they probably receive all of them at one point. In 2007, San Bruno would receive the [CEC 2005 Remodel Program]({{< ref "wiki/CEC 2005 Remodel Program.md" >}}). In 2019, the location would receive the [CEC 2018 2.0 Remodel Program]({{< ref "wiki/CEC 2018 20 Remodel Program.md" >}}), removing the 1-Stage for a 2019 ModelChuck E. Live Stage (Dance Floor) ( Dance Floor). As of September 2023, San Bruno still has the 2.0 remodel.
