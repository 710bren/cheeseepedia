##Showtape Release##
Beginning with the release of the [September 1998]({{< ref "wiki/September 1998.md" >}}) and paired up alongside the live show Give My Regards To Broadway, Birthday Star '95 would be reissued as Birthday Star '98. This release of the show was identical to that of the previous, however the Mr. Mouth pre-show was removed. The character had been retired in [August 1995]({{< ref "wiki/Destination Imagination.md" >}}) and as the years went on his introduction became increasingly outdated so it was dropped. Now the show was presented in an identical form to Birthday Star '92 as an isolated song that simply played from beginning to end with no intro or outro. This reissue would be released on Cyberstar SVHS tapes for 3-Stage and R12, (C & R showtapes had been discontinued following [Blast From The Past]({{< ref "wiki/Blast From The Past.md" >}}) in January 1998) and on LaserDisc for Studio C. Between April 1999 and August 1999, CEC Entertainment Inc. transitioned all Studio C locations from using LaserDiscs to DVDs. Beginning with Fabulous World Adventure (Chuck E.'s Fabulous World Adventure), shows were released on 2-3 DVD discs containing audio and video and floppy disks containing signals. Birthday Star '98 would see a release on DVD + Floppy shows as such. It would remain this way until January 2001 when Birthday Star '95/98 were discontinued and invalidated in favor of its successor, Birthday Star 2001.
