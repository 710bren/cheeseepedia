Over the past 40 years Jungle Jim's has had various props from the Rock Afire Explosion installed at various places. Some of those being Moonshine jugs, Rocks & Rolfe's Rainbow. These were all located at <i>Jungle Jim's International Market</i> in Cincinnati, Ohio. (5440 Dixie Hwy, Fairfield, OH 45014) at one time.
