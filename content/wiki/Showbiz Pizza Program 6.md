**_Showbiz Pizza Program 6**_ is a music cassette released alongside Showbiz Pizza Place and Pizza Time Theatre showtapes as background music between segments. This would eventually evolve into [Cyberstar]({{< ref "wiki/Cyberstar.md" >}}), though the cassettes would still be produced for stores not yet converted to it.

These programs were still produced by _Sight & Sound Entertainment Corporation_, however the company would be merged into _Audio Environments Inc.,_ rebranding as _AEI Music_. Under AEI, the company would become specialized in creating music tape compilations for retail stores and airlines. This provided a specific mood tailored to the store, in which AEI describes to '-harmonize with the lifestyle of (the store's) patrons'<ref>http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/aei-music-network-inc-history/</ref> The Showbiz Pizza Programs were specifically labeled as _Inflight Audio Entertainment_, and each gave the address of AEI Music Network Inc. at the bottom of the label.
