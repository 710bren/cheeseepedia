<b><i>Dog</b></i> (also known as <b><i>The Dog</b></i>) was a retrofit of [Mr. Munch (Cyberamic)]({{< ref "wiki/Mr Munch (Cyberamic).html" >}}) used at the [Fun Zone & Pizza]({{< ref "wiki/Fun Zone & Pizza.html" >}}) on [Chico, CA (966 East Ave)]({{< ref "wiki/Chico, CA (966 East Ave).html" >}}). The bot was retrofitted after the location lost its license to the CEC IP. 

<h2> History </h2>

<h2>= As Mr. Munch </h2>=
The bot was originally produced somewhere from 1981 to 1982 & was placed at the Pizza Time Theatre on [Chico, CA (966 East Ave)]({{< ref "wiki/Chico, CA (966 East Ave).html" >}}) in July 1982. The bot had standard PTT attire. In 1993, The bot would gain new CEC styled cosmetics when Chico got their [2-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/2-Stage.html" >}}). The bot also replaced its former arm mechanics for new arm mechanics

In January 2011, The Chuck E. Cheese's in [[Chico, CA (966 East Ave)|Chico, CA]] lost its license to run as a CEC, forcing them to change their branding to Fun Zone & Pizza. They converted their Munch's Make Believe Band characters into generic animals, The Dog uses a generic mascot costume instead of the Munch Cyberamic ones, though they still had the originally Keyboard from their 2-Stage. The bot's head had a tin can either over it or replacing its former one.

When Fun Zone & Pizza closed in September 2011, the characters were stripped from their cosmetics and removed and sold in a group for $100. It is unknown if anybody purchased them or where they are today.
