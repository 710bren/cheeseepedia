<p>The <b>'The C Files' (Must C TV Award)</b> was a poster created for Chuck E. Cheese in 1998.</p>
<p><h2> Design </h2></p>
<p>This poster features a parody of the TV Show 'The X Files' which has Chuck E. in a detective outfit while holding a flashlight, Helen is depicted screaming and running, and also Jasper is seen running away. On top of the poster is 2 aliens spaceship invading earth with one of them about the abduct Helen or Jasper.</p>
<p><h2> Size/Dimensions </h2></p>
<p>Like the other 'Must C TV' posters, this was made larger than actual TV posters, so it'd be cheaper and easier to retrofit the Phase 2 'record posters' with them.</p>
<p><h2> Reception </h2></p>
<p>The poster originally received generally positive reception upon release, however, as time passed, it began to get a more negative reception, with many critics of the Original Phase Trilogy using this as a literal poster child for showing how dated pre-2005 Chuck E. Cheese's stores are. Nowadays, it does have a cult following, either due to how absurd the poster is, or due to the 90s nostalgia boom.</p>
