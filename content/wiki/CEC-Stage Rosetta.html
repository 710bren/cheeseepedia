<p><b><i>CEC-Stage Rosetta</b></i> was a special software created by <i>Dave Philipson</i> in 1997 used to translate programming from the 3-Stage to the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics" >}}">Cyberamics</a> stage.</p>
<p>This was done to reduce unneeded programming of characters across both stages and began use in the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/August 1997 Show" >}}">August 1997</a> showtape. The name <i>CEC-Stage Rosetta</i> was used as the software could be described as 'Translating' the programming information from the 3-Stage <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Bit Chart" >}}">Bit Chart</a> to the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics" >}}">Cyberamics</a> equivalent bits.</p>
<p><h2> Conversion Process </h2></p>
<p>The conversion process can be reverse engineered by comparing multiple showtapes' signals from both stages. Given this, showtapes where signal data is lost or private for CEC-Stage can be recreated from the official conversion chart, assuming no bugs or additional programming wasn't added in the official release.</p>
<p>Bits will be named and numbered by their conversion to the <b><i>Road, 1 + 2</b></i> <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Bit Chart" >}}">Bit Chart</a> format. Other Cyberamic stages before the creation of the <i>CEC-Stage Rosetta</i> software would be using the bits for different purposes.</p>
