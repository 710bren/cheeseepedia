<b>1370 Murfreesboro Pike</b> was the second and last Pizza Time Theater in Tennessee that opened on November 14, 1982 and closed in 1984, likely due to the bankruptcy.

<h2> History </h2>
The store opened with a balcony stage. The location was apparently a franchised location. The building was demolished around 2012-2013. Not very much is known about this location so if you have any more information, please contact me.

<h2> Animatronics </h2>
The known animatronics consisted of Mr Munch (likely but no known pictures are shown), Jasper T. Jowls, Chuck E. Cheese, Madame Oink, and Chef Pasqually. It is unknown if this location ever had Harmony Howlett before Madame Oink or Helen Henny.
