**_19125 W Bluemound Road**_ is a Chuck E. Cheese's restaurant located in Brookfield, Wisconsin.

This location opened on December 17th, 1997, and is the first location to feature the Studio C Alpha stage, and first location with any form of the Studio C stage.

## History ## 
Brookfield was originally a franchised location, being owned by the same franchisee as the  and  stores. This store was a relocation of the original  Pizza Time Theatre location. This new Brookfield location is the first CEC to feature any form of the Studio C stage, and was also located on an actual street named Cheese E. St, and even had a custom road sign with the Coach Chuck logo on top of the sign. The sign was removed in Spring 2022, but is safe in a private collection.

The location (as well as West Allis and Milwaukee) was acquired by CEC Entertainment, Inc on December 20th, 1998, a little over a year after the current Brookfield store opened. 

As of 2022, Brookfield still has their Studio C stage operational. It still has many prototype features, such as the pizza phone, desk, and the actual Chuck E. and Bird animatronics themselves, which are well maintained by the technician who has worked on the show since the store opened.
