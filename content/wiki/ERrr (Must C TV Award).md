The <b>'ERrr' (Must C TV Award)</b> was a poster created for Chuck E. Cheese's in 1998.

<h2> Design </h2>
This poster features Chuck E. in a parody version of Doug Ross from the TV Show 'ER' having gray hair and a doctors outfit. While Munch is in the background assisting Chuck E. and a speaker in the background yells out 'Dr. Cheese To ER. STAT !!'

<h2> Size/Dimensions </h2>
Like the other 'Must C TV' posters, this was made larger than actual TV posters, so it'd be cheaper and easier to retrofit the Phase 2 'record posters' with them.

<h2> Reception </h2>
The poster originally received generally positive reception upon release, however, as time passed, it began to get a more negative reception, with many critics of the Original Phase Trilogy using this as a literal poster child for showing how dated pre-2005 Chuck E. Cheese's stores are. Nowadays, it does have a cult following, either due to how absurd the poster is, or due to the 90s nostalgia boom.
