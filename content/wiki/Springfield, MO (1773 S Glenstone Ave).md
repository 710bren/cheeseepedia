**_1773 S Glenstone Ave**_ was a _Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre_ that opened on April 20, 1982 and closed on December 31, 1983 with a [Balcony Stage]({{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage.md" >}}). 

This is not to be confused with [Springfield, MO (3500-A S Glenstone Ave)]({{< ref "wiki/Springfield, MO (3500-A S Glenstone Ave).md" >}}), which opened on January 10, 1994 and is still open today with a 2.0 remodel.

## History ##
Springfield opened on April 20, 1982 with a [Balcony Stage]({{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage.md" >}}). Unfortunately, there is basically no information on this store at all. The store closed on December 31, 1983 for unknown reasons. The store held an auction in January 1984, and as a result, the location was vacant. It was left like this way for multiple years, until Midnight Rodeo moved onto the space. As of August 2023, Midnight Rodeo occupies the space.
