<b><i>1773 S Glenstone Ave</b></i> was a <i>Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre</i> that opened on April 20, 1982 and closed on December 31, 1983 with a [Balcony Stage]({{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage.md" >}}). 

This is not to be confused with [Springfield, MO (3500-A S Glenstone Ave)]({{< ref "wiki/Springfield, MO (3500-A S Glenstone Ave).md" >}}), which opened on January 10, 1994 and is still open today with a 2.0 remodel.

<h2> Stage </h2>
Springfield opened with a [Balcony Stage]({{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage.md" >}}). However, nothing is known about this location at all, and after the closure, the bots were presumably auctioned in January 1984, and currently, the fates of the bots are unknown.

<h2> History </h2>
Springfield opened on April 20, 1982 with a [Balcony Stage]({{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage.md" >}}). Unfortunately, there is basically no information on this store at all. The store closed on December 31, 1983 for unknown reasons. The store held an auction in January 1984, and as a result, the location was vacant. It was left like this way for multiple years, until Midnight Rodeo moved onto the space. As of August 2023, Midnight Rodeo occupies the space.
