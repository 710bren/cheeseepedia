<h2>Transcript</h2>
The segment is narrated entirely by Annetta Wilson, with some spoken moments by Aaron Fechter.<blockquote><b>Annetta Wilson:</b> Well, how do you turn a dream into a thriving business, a lot of fun, and good eating? I found out today that it all started with this man's idea. 27-year-old Aaron Fechter decided that with a little electronic know-how and the right vehicle, enjoying a meal would never be the same. So, his 100 employees at Creative Engineering welded, molded, sewed, and bolted together the most unique rock band around- the Rock-afire Explosion.
<b>Billy Bob:</b> Howdy folks, I'm Billy Bob.
<b>Annetta Wilson:</b> The band performs at ShowBiz Pizza Place, a new concept in dining out, but the most unique part of it is that it's all done right here in Orlando.
<b>Aaron Fechter:</b> 'We like to do it all in-house so that we can keep control over it. The mask making, the fiberglass making, the metal work, and all of that, the music - everything we produce right here.'
<b>Annetta Wilson:</b> The restaurant also has a huge game room for the more playful types. Fechtor started out as a one-man operation, so what's next? He says a recording career for the group.'</blockquote>
