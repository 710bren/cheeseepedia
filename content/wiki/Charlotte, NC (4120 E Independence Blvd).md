## History ##
Charlotte opened with either Harmony Howlette or Madame Oink. Charlotte would later get Helen who stayed until Charlotte Permanently Closed. This was one of two Pizza Time Theatres in North Carolina (And the Carolinas as well as South Carolina only had Showbiz) and was also the 2nd to last Pizza Time Theatre to open in the state.

After Bradenton closed in 1984, the store had an auction like most PTTs. The building it was located in was reoccupied by an unknown tenant, the building was then demolished for a highway expansion sometime in 2002. As of June 2023, the highway expansion still sits on the site of the plot of land where the PTT once sat.
