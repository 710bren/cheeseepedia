The <b><i>Dr. Juke Test Tape</b></i> was an unreleased showtape testing the [Dr. Juke]({{< ref "wiki/Dr Juke.md" >}}) show selector concept.  

The tape was the only of its kind using the [CEI LaserDisc]({{< ref "wiki/CEI LaserDisc.md" >}}) format, where during the showtape segments the video contained PCM adaptor audio for the showtapes, and the LaserDisc audio tracks contained show control data.  

Similar to what would become [Studio C]({{< ref "wiki/Studio C.md" >}}) showtapes, programs outside the segments were placed on the disc, allowing software to control animated segments while a show was waiting to be selected.
