The **_Statue of Liberty**_ was a retrofit of [Rolfe Dewolfe & Earl Schmerle (Animatronic)]({{< ref "wiki/Rolfe Dewolfe & Earl Schmerle (Animatronic).md" >}}) produced by [ShowBiz Pizza Place]({{< ref "wiki/ShowBiz Pizza Place.md" >}}) and Creative Presentations in 1986 for the 100th anniversary of the Statue of Liberty- alongside an SPP Happy B-day Liberty (accompanying showtape), which was used in stores up until [Concept Unification]({{< ref "wiki/Concept Unification.md" >}}) completed in 1992.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20240827175450/https://www.ebay.com/itm/256617734801?var=&widget_ver=artemis&media=COPY</ref><ref>https://www.showbizpizza.com/rae/characters/liberty.html</ref>

170 units would be produced at the time for all ShowBiz stores, used as a seasonal retrofit in the Summer. The animatronic would be used for the SPP Happy B-day Liberty, SPP Liberty '87, CEI Liberty '87, and [SPP Liberty Wave Cyber]({{< ref "wiki/SPP Liberty Wave Cyber.md" >}}) showtapes. Rolfe's backdrop would also be retrofitted to match the ShowBiz Campground sky, alongside a US styled banner.<ref>https://youtu.be/PZ-zOdZIi08</ref>
