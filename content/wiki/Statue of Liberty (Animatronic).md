The **_Statue of Liberty**_ was a retrofit of [\2](\1), which was used in stores up until [[Concept Unification]] completed in 1992.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20240827175450/https://www.ebay.com/itm/256617734801?var=&widget_ver=artemis&media=COPY</ref><ref>https://www.showbizpizza.com/rae/characters/liberty.html</ref>

170 units would be produced at the time for all ShowBiz stores, used as a seasonal retrofit in the Summer. The animatronic would be used for the [[SPP Happy B-day Liberty]], [[SPP Liberty '87]], [[CEI Liberty '87]], and [[SPP Liberty Wave Cyber]] showtapes. Rolfe's backdrop would also be retrofitted to match the ShowBiz Campground sky, alongside a US styled banner.<ref>https://youtu.be/PZ-zOdZIi08</ref>
