<b><i>Grand Junction, CO (2424 US Hwy 6 & 50)</b></i> was a <i>Chuck E. Cheese's</i> that opened on August 27th, 2003, with a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Studio C Cappa" >}}">Studio C Cappa</a> Prototype and closed on June 19th, 2020.
<h2>History</h2>
Grand Junction opened outside of the Mesa Mall, it had a Small-Town Studio C Prototype with a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Chuck E Cheese 16m (Animatronic)" >}}">Chuck E. Cheese 16m (Animatronic)</a> and including the 2000â€™s version of the SPT 1992/1993 Remodel Program. It also had a Cool Chuck sign near the mall's entrance. The bot had the Cool Chuck outfit before switching to the Avenger outfit in the 2010's, and getting the Rockstar shirt, but keeping the Avenger shorts until closure. The store had kept its original exterior, and the interior got an update in 2016, but kept some original stuff after remodeling. Grand Junction remained like this until it's closure in 2020 due to the COVID-19 and the bankruptcy. They left the awning and letter signs intact until being removed in 2021. After closure, the location remained vacant until another arcade moved into the former space until closing in 2022. As of September 2023, the building is vacant again.
