## Stages ##
Originally when the store opened, they had a Rock-Afire Explosion, as all other Showbiz locations had. In the early 1990's, the store would undergo Concept Unification, turning the RAE into Munch's Make-Believe Band. On September 16th, 1996, the store was bought out by Corporate. They would have the 3-Stage until September 2017, when they would receive the Circles of Light stage from the San Antonio, TX (6874 Ingram Dr), which received one of the first 2.0 remodels because of a faulty sprinkler system; damaging the 3-Stage and causing its removal. They would have the stage until October 12, 2020, when they would close because of the COVID-19 pandemic. On October 2nd, 2022, they reopened the store as a 2.0 with a Dance Floor.
