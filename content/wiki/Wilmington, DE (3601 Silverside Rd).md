**3601 Silverside Rd** was a Showbiz Pizza Place that opened on March 3, 1983 with a Rock-Afire Explosion, and closed on October 12, 2020

This location received Concept Unification in the early 1990's, and replaced the 3-Stage with a Circles of Light from San Antonio, Texas (6874 Ingram Dr) in 2017. This location will be reopening as a Chuck E. Cheese sometime in 2022 or possible 2023.

##  Stages ## 
Originally when the store opened, they had a Rock-Afire Explosion, as all other Showbiz locations had. In the early 1990's, the store would undergo Concept Unification, turning the RAE into Munch's Make Believe Band. They would have the 3-Stage until 2017, when they would receive the Circles of Light stage from the San Antonio, TX (6874 Ingram Dr), which received one of the first 2.0 remodels. They would have the stage until October 12, 2020, when they would close because of the COVID-19 pandemic. As of September 2022, they are planning on reopening the store as a 2.0 with a Dance Floor.
