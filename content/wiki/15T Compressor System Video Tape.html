The <b><i>15T Compressor System Video Tape</b></i> was a training tape released in 1992 detailing how to service the 3-Stage <i>Ingersoll Rand</i> compressor.

The only account of the tape's contents comes from a private owner, stating that the main portion of the video features a technician explaining how the compressor works, along with how to service it. A video from <i>Ingersoll Rand</i> themselves is also features, going over similar issues and breakdowns of the compressor.<ref>https://www.instagram.com/p/CeR2CTnp5M36Rgnnrjn2mYNL80CaKGXCUaWYvY0/</ref> The claim also states another private owner having a [Rerelease]({{< ref "wiki/15T Compressor System Video Tape 1993 Rerelease.md" >}}) of the tape under the <i>Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza</i> branding, presumably only on the tape's label.
