<p><b>2307 I-35E</b> was a Pizza Time Theatre that opened in 1983 with a Balcony Stage, which closed in 1984 due to the company's bankruptcy.</p>
<p>This location has very little known history about it, only a little bit of advertising has been found.</p>
<p>It should not be confused with <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Denton, TX (341 South I-35)" >}}">Denton, TX (341 South I-35)</a>, which is the current Chuck E. Cheese's location.</p>
<p><h2>History</h2></p>
<p>In 1983 the location would open outside of Golden Triangle Mall inside of the Denton Town Center Complex. Due to no known footage or pictures of the location during opening, the store has very little documentation.</p>
<p>After the closure in 1984, the location would be transformed into a Pier 1 Imports. It would run until the 2000's where it would be transformed into a Petco. At this time, Petco would gut the building leaving no interior walls. The Petco would close around 2016-2018.</p>
<p>Today, the location sits as an Envy Salon Suites. New walls were put up and now the only remaining part of its past is the outside structure.</p>
<p><h2>Stages</h2></p>
<p>The location would open with a Balcony Stage. It is unknown what features this balcony may have had.</p>
<p>The location would also contain The King. Like the Balcony Stage, it is unknown what features it may have had.</p>
