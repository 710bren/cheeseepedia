<p><h2>History</h2></p>
<p>Placentia opened on September 24th, 1991, as a corporate-owned location. This location opened with the 1988 Remodel, CU decor, and the Road Stage. Around the mid-late 1990s, They replaced the logo with Coach Chuck and removed older 90's decor for newer decor and SkyTubes. In May 2007, the fan convention Cheese-Vention 4 was held at this location after the attendees were kicked out of the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Fullerton, CA (1134 S Harbor Blvd)" >}}">Fullerton</a> location during their remodel. In 2009, Placentia remodeled to the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/CEC 2005 Remodel Program" >}}">CEC 2005 Remodel</a> which involved the removal of the showroom walls, removing older decor for newer decor, new booths, & adding purple walls. Strangely, the brown checkers were added, and the logo, text, and awnings were not replaced. In the Early 2010s, Placentia was remodeled to the 2010 Update which involved redoing the front counter and Salad Bar. In April 2023, this store began their 2017 2.0 Remodel Program|2.0 Remodel, which involved removing the Road Stage in favor of a 2021 Model Dance Floor + Video Wall. As of May 2023, the location is still open with the 2.0 Remodel and the 2021 Model Dance Floor + Video Wall.</p>
<p><h2>Stages</h2></p>
<p>Like all Road Stages when they first opened, Chuck wore his Tuxedo & Derby outfit. Also, the stage featured no curtains like any other Road Stage from its first installation. Up and Down curtains were added by the Late 90's. In the Early 2000s, this was replaced with the Cool Chuck outfit. By the Late 2000's, Chuck's outfit was replaced with the Avenger outfit.</p>
<p>in April 2023, Placentia began the 2.0 remodel, during this time the Road Stage was removed and replaced with a 2021 Model Dance Floor + Video Wall which was installed on the back wall to the left of the former Road Stage.</p>
