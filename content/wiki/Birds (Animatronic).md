These one of a kind animatronic Birds were created exclusively for the [Irving, TX Showbiz Pizza]({{< ref "wiki/Irving, TX (3903 W Airport Fwy).md" >}}) for use on their Chuck E.'s House ('Chuck E.'s House') stage. The manufacturer is unknown.

<h2> Movement Rosetta </h2>
These birds repurpose the mouth and spotlight signals used for the [Warblettes]({{< ref "wiki/Warblettes (Cyberamic).md" >}}) and [Flowers]({{< ref "wiki/Singing Flowers (Cyberamic).md" >}}).

<h2> Cosmetic Design </h2>
The yellow birds sit in a large nest with foliage above the Chuck E. Cheese Cyberamic character. Each of the birds appear to have a tuft of hair coming out of each of their heads and have simple black eyes and orange beaks.
