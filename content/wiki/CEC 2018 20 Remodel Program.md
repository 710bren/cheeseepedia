## Special 2.0's ##

* There are several locations that have custom murals put into the store, some of these having to do when the store remodeled, such as Brandon, Florida, who got the 2.0 remodel in March 2021 and has a mural that uses elements from the Summer of Fun promotion.
* The  location, which received 2.0 in 2018 and 2019, is the largest location in the United States, they received a Circles Of Light stage instead of a Dance Floor, but installed one in Spring 2022, it is bigger than other Dance Floors, they have a third floor, but is only accesible to employees. That third floor has many one of a kind artwork from when it was a Pizza Time Theatre, and even still has carpet with PTT Chuck's head on it.
