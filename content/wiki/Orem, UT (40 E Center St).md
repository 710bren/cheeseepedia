**_40 E Center St**_ was a _Chuck E. Cheese’s_ that opened on August 31, 1983 as a _ShowBiz Pizza Place_ with a Rock afire Explosion, which closed on July 30, 2017 as a CEC with a 3-Stage.


## Stages## 
Orem opened with the Rock afire Explosion in 1983. Unfortunately, there are no photos or videos to exist of Orem with the Rock afire, or as a ShowBiz in general.

In July 1992, Orem received Concept Unification, converting the Rock afire into Munch’s Make Believe Band, which they would keep until closure in 2017.

Throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s, Orem’s stage would receive plastic masks, and most notably be declining in condition, as seen in the earliest known video of the stage in 2003. In 2007, Chuck E.’s tuxedo was replaced with the Cool Chuck outfit. He would also predictably receive Cyberamic hands at this time.

By 2008, the condition of the stage was very poor. Many movements are seen with bad flow control adjustments, or just simply not working. In a video from 2012, Orem is seen in better condition than it was in 2008, but still rather poor. Building, Moon, and the Wink are all Pizzacam and Munch Jr. would also be removed around this time.

In 2014, Orem received cosmetic pieces from the Sandy, UT store which had closed. However, Orem was unable to use any of these cosmetics due to them being Cyberamic, making them incompatible.

In 2015, the condition of the stage had gotten worse. For example, Pasqually barely moved, and very loud squeaks were occasionally heard which is very abnormal. The condition of the stage would remain mostly the same until closure in 2017.

## Post Closure## 
In 2017, it was announced the Orem store would be closing after 34 years of operation. The owner was fighting cancer, and there was also mold all over the walls in the storage rooms. On July 30, 2017, Orem closed its doors for the final time. However, for their stage, that wouldn’t be the end.

The owners of the Billings, MT, and Fargo, ND locations ultimately ended up purchasing Orem’s show. Chuck E., Munch, Jasper, and Pasqually were sent to Billings, and Helen, Building, and Moon were sent to Fargo. Billings still used the three characters they have for parts to this day, whereas Fargo no longer has their 3-Stage, and the Orem characters were saved by a collector.

## Videos## 
These are any videos found of the location on YouTube in modern day. Just link directly to the video with its presumed filming date. This is also good for making direct citations to claims made in the history section, and if anything notable in the video shows something about its history, it should be described.
