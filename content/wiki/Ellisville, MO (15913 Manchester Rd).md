**_15913 Manchester Rd, Store #947**_ is a Chuck E. Cheese that opened on August 21, 1990 with the Rocker Stage, which is still open to this day currently receiving the CEC 2018 2.0 Remodel Program (2.0 Remodel).

It is located in the Ellisville Square Shopping Center.
##History##
Ellisville opened on August 21st, 1990, as part of an expansion of the shopping center it was in. Unfortunately, there is not much information on this location when it had the 1988 Remodel. This location opened with the 1988 Remodel which includes the CU decor, checkers around the store, the Blue and White awnings, and the Rocker Stage. In 1994, Ellisville would receive a minor remodel which added a lot of 1990s decor and removed the CU decor, and added assets such as the Record Posters, Colored Chase Lights, and the removal of the Rocker Stage for the 1-Stage. In 2005-2006, it would undergo the [CEC 2005 Remodel Program]({{< ref "wiki/CEC 2005 Remodel Program.md" >}}) which involved the expansion of the exterior and store, the removal of the early 2000's posters, the new decor and booths, and the removal of the 1-Stage for the 3rd Generation Studio C Cappa. By October 10th, 2023, the store would start its 2.0 remodel beginning with the destruction of the store's show.
## Stages##
Originally, Ellisville had a Rocker Stage. In 1994, they would receive the 1-Stage. Some parts of Ellisvilleâ€™s 1-Stage would be taken and used at Fairview Heights, IL.

In 2005-2006, the 1-Stage was replaced by the Studio C Cappa and would stay until October 10th, 2023, when the store's animatronic would be destroyed in favor of the store receiving the 2.0 Remodel.
