**_15913 Manchester Rd**_ is a Chuck E. Cheese that opened on August 21, 1990 with the Rocker Stage, which is still open to this day.

It is located in the Ellisville Square Shopping Center.
##History##
Ellisville opened on August 21st, 1990, as part of an expansion of the shopping center it was in. Unfortunately, there is not much information on this location when it was a Phase 2 (1988 Remodel). This location opened with the 1988 Remodel (Phase 2) which includes the CU decor, checkers around the store, the Blue and White awnings, and the Rocker Stage. In around the Mid 1990's, Ellisville would receive a minor remodel which added a lot of 1990s decor and removed the CU decor, and assets such as the Record Posters, Colored Chase Lights, and the removal of the Rocker Stage for the 1-Stage. In the Late 90's, Ellisville would receive the Phase 2 remodel (Phase 3 by the community) which got a new exterior (Which involved an expansion of the front of the store to make room for more games) and most of the 90s decor was removed and the 2000's decor and SkyTubes was added. In 2005-2006, it would undergo the 2005 update to the [https://chuckepedia.com/wiki/2003_%22Cool_Chuck%22_Reconfiguration_/_Major_Remodel_Initiative 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative] (2005 Remodel/Phase 4) which involved the expansion of the exterior and store, the removal of the early 2000's posters, the new decor and booths, and the removal of the 1-Stage for the Studio C Cappa. Around 2011 or 2012, the Cappa elements were removed like [Cincinnati, OH (4394 Eastgate Square Dr)]({{< ref "wiki/Cincinnati, OH (4394 Eastgate Square Dr).md" >}}) and replaced with Beta elements, thus converting the Cappa into a Beta. Currently, as of February 2023, Ellisville still has the 2005 Remodel and the Studio C Beta stage and is safe from the 2.0 remodel.
##Stages##
Originally, Ellisville had a Rocker Stage. In the mid 90's most likely 1994 or 1995, they would receive the 1-Stage. 

In 2006-2007, the 1-Stage was replaced by the Studio C Cappa.

In 2011 or 2012, Cappa elements were removed and replaced with the Beta elements converting the Cappa into the Beta which they still have today.
