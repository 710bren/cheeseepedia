SPP EMERGENCY BACKUP TAPE
Serial #00153 Deck - 8
07/20/90 - Master CYBERSTAR}}

For some stores, this was the last tape used before _Concept Unification_ would start at their location. Each tape sent after [SPP Christmas '89 / Wave Bday]({{< ref "wiki/SPP Christmas '89  Wave Bday.md" >}}) would become increasingly more rare as stores would convert to _3-Stages._

Despite the later years of _Cyberstar_ being mostly re-used segments from earlier showtapes, the last showtapes became the 'Best of' series, bringing back every single _Cyberstar_ segment for stores to have. It was said at this time that due to the _Rock-afire Explosion_ being phased out, stores could play whatever showtapes they had without sticking to the most recent show. The _Best of_ series could be seen as an encouragement of this.

## Emergency Backup Format ##
As stated in the [Concept Unification Installation Manual]({{< ref "wiki/Concept Unification Installation Manual.md" >}}), the emergency backup tapes were used in the event of a deck failure. A deck failure would mean the store would need to order a consumer stereo deck as a replacement, which could not support the 4-channel audio of a standard showtape. A standard tape had audio on Hifi left/right, with the programming signals on linear left/right, while the emergency tape duplicated the signals to both linear and Hifi left, and the audio to both linear and Hifi right. This resulted in the birthday and house light dimming signals being lost, with only the standard shows being able to play.
