**_200 W Roosevelt Rd**_ is a Chuck E. Cheese's location that opened on August 7, 2001 in the Villa Oaks Shopping Center with a [[Studio C Beta]], which is still open to this day.

##  History ## 
Originally when the store opened, they had a Studio C Beta, 32M, first one in the state of Illinois. In the 2009-2011, they would receive the [[2005 Remodel]] which involved painting the patterns around the logo (They kept the same logo from opening until they replaced the logo on the exterior). In around 2013-2014, they replaced the logo with the 2013 logo and remained that way until the 2.0 remodel. In April 2022, they started remodeling to 2.0, removing the Studio C Beta and adding a Dance Floor + Video Wall.
