The **_Dolli Dimples [Cyberamics]({{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics.md" >}})**_ were a set of animatronics created by [Pizza Time Theatre]({{< ref "wiki/Pizza Time Theatre.md" >}}) in the early 80's for the Cabaret. This animatronic first premiered at the [Concord, CA (1975 Diamond Blvd)]({{< ref "wiki/Concord, CA (1975 Diamond Blvd).md" >}}) in 1979. She now appeared much more simplified and polished than her first appearance in [San Jose, CA (1371 Kooser Rd)]({{< ref "wiki/San Jose, CA (1371 Kooser Rd).md" >}}).
