Later in 1994/95, they received the SPT 1992/1993 Remodel Program, and got a [2-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/2-Stage.html" >}}). Then in late 2006, they received the [CEC 2005 Remodel Program]({{< ref "wiki/CEC 2005 Remodel Program.html" >}}), relocated the showroom, and got a [Studio C Beta]({{< ref "wiki/Studio C Beta.html" >}}). In April 2023, they received the [CEC 2018 2.0 Remodel Program]({{< ref "wiki/CEC 2018 20 Remodel Program.html" >}}) removing the Studio C for a [[Chuck E.
