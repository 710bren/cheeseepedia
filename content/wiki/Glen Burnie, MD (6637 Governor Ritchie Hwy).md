##History##
Glen Burnie opened on November 7th, 1990 as a corporate-owned location. Glen Burnie opened with the 1988 Remodel including the CU decor, the Blue and White awnings, the checkers around the store, and the Rocker Stage. Around the Mid 1990's, Glen Burnie received a minor remodel; removing older 90's decor for newer decor, and the removal of the Rocker Stage for the 2-Stage. In the late 90's, they would receive the Phase 2 remodel (Phase 3 by community) which includes an expansion to make room for more games, and removing older decor for newer decor, and the removal of the ball pit for SkyTubes. Glen Burnie remained like this until in 2006-2007, when they received the 2005 update to the [https://chuckepedia.com/wiki/2003_%22Cool_Chuck%22_Reconfiguration_/_Major_Remodel_Initiative 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative] which involved the removal of the showroom walls, removing older decor for newer decor, new booths, & adding purple walls. Glen Burnie remained like this until in December 2018 when they received the 2.0 remodel removing the 2-Stage for the Dance Floor. Strangely, the old 90's door is still there and was not replaced. Currently, as of February 2023, the location still has the 2.0 Remodel and the Dance Floor.
##Stages##
Like all Rocker Stages at the time, Chuck wore his PTT outfit. 

The stage was replaced for the 2-Stage in the Mid 90's. 

In the Early 2000's, Chuck's Tuxedo outfit was replaced with the Cool Chuck outfit. 

By the Late 2000's, Chuck's outfit was replaced with the Avenger outfit.

In December 2018, the stage was removed for the 2.0 Remodel and Dance Floor.

As of February 2023, Glen Burnie still has the Dance Floor and Video Wall and 2.0 Remodel.
