**_6637 Governor Ritchie Hwy, Store #474**_ is a _Chuck E. Cheese's_ that opened on November 7, 1990, as a corporate location that had the last [Chuck E.'s House]({{< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House.md" >}}) (Rocker Stage). It is located in the Governor Plaza Shopping Center.
## History##

### Pre-Chuck E. Cheese's (October 24th, 1973-January 1988)###
Before Glen Burnie was a Chuck E. Cheese's location, the building housed a movie theater called Ritchie Cinemas 1-2-3, which opened its doors on October 24, 1973, and was closed in January 1988. The building remained vacant for around 2 years until opening as a Chuck E. Cheese's, in which the company gutted and rebuilt the entire interior to their liking.

###As Chuck E. Cheese's / Chuck E. Cheese (November 1990-Present) ###
Glen Burnie opened as a corporate-owned location and was the first location to open in Maryland after the merger. Glen Burnie opened with the 1988 Remodel. Sometime between 1995 and 1997, Glen Burnie received updates in line with the 1994 SPT Repositioning / Remodel Program. By this point, the [Chuck E.'s House]({{< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House.md" >}}) was replaced with a 2-Stage. 

Sometime between 2005 and 2007 the store was updated through the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative. Glen Burnie remained like this until in December 2018, when they received the 2.0 remodel, which saw the removal of the 2-Stage. The only remaining fixtures were the entryway doors, from the 1990s. This was the first 2.0 remodel in the state of Maryland.

In October 2022, the Governor Plaza Shopping Center went through an exterior refresh, according to a Street View photo. Fandom members report that the updated exterior for the store was completed in March 2023.
## Stages##
Like all Rocker Stages at the time, Chuck wore his PTT outfit. The stage was replaced by a 2-Stage in 1993. In the early 2000's, Chuck's tuxedo outfit was replaced with the Cool Chuck outfit. By the late 2000's/early 2010's, Chuck's outfit was replaced with the Avenger outfit. 

In December 2018, the stage was removed for the 2.0 Remodel and Dance Floor.
