<p><b><i>Decatur, AL (1801 Beltline Road, Store #906)</b></i> is a Chuck E. Cheese's that opened on December 26, 2005 with a Small-Town Studio C|Studio C Cappa, and is still open to this day.</p>
<p><h2> Stages </h2></p>
<p><h3> Studio C Cappa (December 2005 - Summer 2012) </h3></p>
<p>TODO</p>
<p><h3> Studio C Beta (Summer 2012 - Present) </h3></p>
<p>Sometime between July-August 2012, Decatur's <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Studio C Cappa" >}}">Small-Town Studio C</a> stage show was redesigned into a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Studio C Beta" >}}">Studio C Beta</a> with the features of a Studio C Cappa. Chuck's stage went from being angular and trapezoidal to circular and round. The spiral-looking mountain backdrop behind Chuck E. would be replaced by the Studio C Beta backdrop with new rope lights, tube lights, and the addition of a new animatronic, the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Pizza Time Clock (Animatronic)" >}}">Pizza Time Clock</a>. New flood lights were added above the stage, and the Bluescreen was removed for  'CEC' lettering and lightboxes. The <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Ticket Blaster" >}}">Ticket Blaster</a> was also given it's own exclusive backdrop, and was moved to the left end of the stage. As of October 2023, Decatur still has it's Studio C Beta stage show.</p>
<p><h2>History </h2></p>
<p>Decatur had its grand opening on December 26, 2005 as the first store with the 2005 update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative in Alabama. The store opened inside the Decatur Mall which at the time was growing and expanding for new tenants. Because of the store's small size, it housed a Small-Town Studio C, and the small 'Chuck E's Clubhouse' <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Skytubes" >}}">Skytubes</a> set. The Showroom and Kiddie area were also much smaller when the store opened, and were pushed to the right end of the store.</p>
<p>While bigger CEC stores like <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Huntsville, AL (1220 Jordan Lane)" >}}">Huntsville, AL (1220 Jordan Lane)</a> had three-sided counters, small-town CEC stores like Decatur had two-sided counters. The shorter side of the counter would have only the ordering menu, the other side of the counter was much longer, having both a Prize section and a Salad bar.</p>
<p>Because of Decatur's small size, they did not install a Toddler Zone. Near the end of the Small-Town Studio C's life, the Chuck E. animatronic received the Avenger outfit. Before that, he had the Cool Chuck outfit.</p>
<p><h3>2012 Update</h3></p>
<p>Around August/September of 2012, Decatur received the 2010 update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative. This remodel installed a new carpet, repainted a few walls, removed a small selection of posters, redesigned the restrooms, and expanded the store. The store's Showroom was also expanded during the update, and the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Studio C Cappa" >}}">Studio C Cappa</a> stage show was redesigned into a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Studio C Beta" >}}">Studio C Beta</a>. Decatur would've been one of the last stores to receive a Studio C Beta, as all new <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Circles of Light" >}}">Circles of Light</a> shows started to be rolled out in stores around this time. The back end of the store was also expanded, giving the Kiddie arcades and <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Skytubes" >}}">Skytubes</a> its own designated area. The restrooms were also moved to that new area, as well as a few posters.</p>
<p>Despite Decatur now having more room to add a Toddler Zone, they still did not install one. A small selection of games and rides were also removed, in exchange for some new ones. The counter stayed the same for the most part, just getting a new paint job to a khaki-like color. The exterior stayed the same, as the interior was the only part of the store that changed in the update. In recent times, Decatur received the Trampoline Zone by August 26, 2024.</p>
<p>Decatur was set to receive the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/CEC 2018 20 Remodel Program" >}}">CEC 2018 2.0 Remodel Program</a> in early 2023, however, it was pushed back to the end of 2023. However, when that deadline passed, they did not get the new remodel. They still have their current Cool Chuck remodel to this day, even though the 2.0 remodel start date has been continuously pushed back.</p>
