The **Antioch Animatronic** was an animatronic figure created by Creative Engineering Inc. for Showbiz Pizza Place locations from 1980-1983. Antioch was originally known as the Birthday spider, as he wears a party hat and holds a birthday cake. Antioch would be scrapped during [[Concept Unification]], and its airlines were connected to the [[Wink]].
