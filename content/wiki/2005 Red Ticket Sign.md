The Red Ticket sign was released in stores in 2005 alongside numerous other Avenger Chuck E. Cheese posters and signage. 

## Appearance ##
The sign features Avenger Chuck E. Cheese in the middle of a red ticket that reads, 'EVERYONE'S A WINNER!' The Red Ticket sign is often paired with another, forming a sort of 'pyramid' that looks like bending tickets.
