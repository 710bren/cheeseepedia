<h2> History </h2>
Staten Island opened on April 30, 1993 with the [[1986 SPT Remodel Program|1988 remodel]] and a unique 1-Stage. There isn't much info on Staten Island back then, although we do know they received [[Phase 1 (1994)|Phase I]], [[Phase 2 (1997)|Phase II]], and [[Phase 3 (2000)|Phase III]] at one point.

Around 2008/2009, Staten Island received the 2005 update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative, involving the removal of all 90s decor, showroom walls, balcony seating, added purple walls, and an exterior change. 

In July 2023, Staten Island received the 2.0 Remodel, removing the 1-Stage for a 2021 Model [[Chuck E. Live Stage (Dance Floor)|Dance Floor]] and [Video Wall]({{< ref "wiki/Video Wall.html" >}}). The store would then host its grand reopening on September 20th, 2023.
