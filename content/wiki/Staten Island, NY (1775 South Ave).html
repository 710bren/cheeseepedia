<p><h2> History </h2></p>
<p>Staten Island opened on April 30, 1993 with the 1986 SPT Remodel Program|1988 remodel and a unique 1-Stage. There isn't much info on Staten Island back then, although we do know they received <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Phase 1 (1994)" >}}">Phase I</a>, <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Phase 2 (1997)" >}}">Phase II</a>, and <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Phase 3 (2000)" >}}">Phase III</a> at one point.</p>
<p>Around 2008/2009, Staten Island received the 2005 update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative, involving the removal of all 90s decor, showroom walls, balcony seating, added purple walls, and an exterior change.</p>
<p>In July 2023, Staten Island received the 2.0 Remodel, removing the 1-Stage for a 2021 Model <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Chuck E Live Stage (Dance Floor)" >}}">Dance Floor</a> and <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Video Wall" >}}">Video Wall</a>. The store would then host its grand reopening on September 20th, 2023.</p>
