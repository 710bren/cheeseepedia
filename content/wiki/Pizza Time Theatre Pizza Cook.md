<b><i>Pizza Time Theatre 'Pizza Cook</b></i>' is one of the first <i>Pizza Time Theatre</i> training tapes, released in December of 1981, and used until sometime in 1984.

The tape focused on the cooking portion of an employee's job, being put on a film cartridge with no audio.

<h2> PTT Training Center </h2>
The tape was part of the [PTT Training Center & Test Kitchen]({{< ref "wiki/PTT Training Center & Test Kitchen.md" >}}) program held exclusively at the [San Jose, CA (2445 Fontaine Rd)]({{< ref "wiki/San Jose, CA (2445 Fontaine Rd).md" >}}) location, potentially meaning only one copy was ever made. The tape was also part of a set of training tapes, with the only other one known being the [Pizza Time Theatre Cashiering]({{< ref "wiki/Pizza Time Theatre Cashiering.md" >}}) tape.
