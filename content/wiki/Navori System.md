The **_Existing Stage Showtape Networking Module**_ (current official name unknown), is a device that can be attached to the 3-Stage (and presumably the [Cyberamics]({{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics.md" >}})) for downloading showtape content through an internet connection.

## Testing ##
The [Dallas, TX (7110 S Westmoreland Rd)]({{< ref "wiki/Dallas, TX (7110 S Westmoreland Rd).md" >}}) store began testing the unit in either May or June of 2022. It is unclear if this test was a permanent installation, or only tested at certain times.

The unit plays the normal showtape segments correctly, but reports of issues with either mismatched movements or corrupted signals have been noted for live shows<ref>https://www.instagram.com/p/CgHORZnODuF/</ref>
