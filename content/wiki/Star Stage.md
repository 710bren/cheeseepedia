* The Stage Show used an updated version of  for Studio C to have compatibility with Widescreen & HD Video, Often seen at the predecessor to the [Studio C HD Weigl Control System]({{< ref "wiki/Studio C HD Weigl Control System.md" >}}). This software would be considered obsolete due to apparently always glitching and breaking during shows.
* And it being a previous Studio C Beta, they reused most of the lighting for this stage. The only new lighting included color changing LEDs that would shine on Chuck E. during songs.
* The chair with the 'You're the Star!' signage had a special camera in front of it where an employee would take your photo and display it on the showroom and game room monitors if you were the Birthday Star.
