## History ##

## Stages ##
Originally when the store opened, they had a Studio C Alpha. They would have it for about 20 years, until November of 2019, when they received the 2.0 remodel. The 'Showroom' was relocated to a different corner of the location, and games now fill the old section where the stage was.
