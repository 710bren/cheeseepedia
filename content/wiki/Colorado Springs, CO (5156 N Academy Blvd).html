Colorado Springs originally featured the Rock-Afire Explosion, as all other Showbiz locations did. Colorado Springs would have it for a few years, until around 1991/1992, when they would receive the 1988 remodel, receiving Concept Unification, where the Rock-afire Explosion characters were changed to the Chuck E. Cheese characters, and removing all SPP decor for newer decor, adding the Blue and White awnings, and the checkers. In the mid 1990s, Colorado Springs received a minor remodel removing older CU decor for the Record Posters and Colored Chase Lights. In 2001, Colorado Springs would receive the Phase 3 remodel replacing the 3-Stage with a Studio C Beta, 32m, removing older decor for newer decor, removing Blue and White awnings, removed checkers, and adding SkyTubes and Toddler Zone.

Colorado Springs would remain like this until September 2022, when they would receive the 2.0 remodel, this involved removing the Studio C Beta, 32m stage and replacing it with a [[Chuck E. Live Stage (Dance Floor)|Dance Floor + Video Wall]] which was relocated back to it's original spot. as of March 2023, Colorado Springs still has the 2.0 remodel and Dance Floor + Video Wall.
