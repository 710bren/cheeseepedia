## History ##

### Location as a Pizza Time Theatre / Chuck E. Cheese's ###
The Pizza Time Theatre in Chico California on 966 East Avenue opened in July 1982. The locationed would get the [SPT 1992 Remodel Program]({{< ref "wiki/SPT 1992 Remodel Program.md" >}}) in 1993, which added the CEC Pizza logo & New store Decor. The location would gain a [2-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/2-Stage.md" >}}) in 1993 as well.

### Fun Zone & Pizza ###
Fun Zone & Pizza was created after Chico Lost it's license to the CEC IP. The location would retrofit its animatronics & replace old CEC Decor with new ones (with some allegedly hidden from public view). The company used a dog, cow, & lion as the mascot costumes placed over the bots. The Location would use dollar store items & frozen pizza instead of corporate items. The wall decor also became generic mascot ones though they kept the salad bar sign.

The only location of Fun Zone & Pizza would be Chico, CA as it would close in late 2011 due to unprofitability.
