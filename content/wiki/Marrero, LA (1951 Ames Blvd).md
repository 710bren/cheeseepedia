Marrero, LA opened in the summer of 1982, along with many other new Pizza Time Theatre’s that were opening in Louisiana in the same time period. Not much is known about this location, other then the fact that its stage was a Balcony Stage. We don’t know for sure, but this store might have opened with Madame Oink as the guest star. The store closed in 1984 with many other Pizza Time Theatre’s at the time due to underwhelming performance/bankruptcy of PTT.


However, what make’s this store interesting about it is that after it closed, it got retrofitted into a new place called “J.J’s Pizza Time Theatre”. Unlike most stores that got retrofitted, this was for a new store opening inside the Pizza Time Theatre, and not just being sold to someone during a auction and then being retrofitted. Surprisingly, we have more information on this store than the original Pizza Time Theatre the place originally was. The character’s the place hosted was J.J, Helen, Jasper, Munch, and Pasqually. Even though the original names were kept for every other character (minus J.J), they were all retrofitted to be “J.J’s cajun friends”.


Sadly, J.J’s Pizza Time Theatre did not last long either, as the place would close in late 1986, and be auctioned off to anyone who was intrested.
