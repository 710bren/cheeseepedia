<b><i>Family Album</b></i> is an additional or alternate stage currently known to be installed at six Pizza Time Theatre locations.
The show consisted of a male guitar player, female piano player, and male cello player. Each location was allowed to name the characters. They were manually controlled by a live operator for dialogue and played programmed songs.
<h2> History </h2>
The first stage was installed in Clawson in 1983 but was additional to the Balcony Stage, as well as an exclusive Hot Fudge stage. Warwick received a Family Album during a shortage of Cyberamic animatronics in 1984. As a result of this shortage, Danvers completely removed and shipped their Balcony Stage to the Fall River, MA location in 1985 and received a Family Album show as a replacement. Clawson and Warwick had a 360 degree spinning platform stage with rising curtains. The last Family Album was removed from Warwick in 1990. The animatronics were made by <i>Elnicky Enterprises</i>.
