[[File:Kooser Pasqually.png|thumb]]
**Kooser Pasqually** was the upgraded [Portrait Pasqually]({{< ref "wiki/Winchester Pasqually (Animatronic).md" >}}) used at the opening of the [San Jose, CA (1371 Kooser Road)]({{< ref "wiki/San Jose, CA (1371 Kooser Rd).md" >}}) Pizza Time Theatre in December 1978. It was used until May 1980, when the Portrait Show would be replaced by the [Balcony Stage.]({{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage.md" >}})

## Design ##
Kooser Pasqually was given a much softer appearance than his Winchester counterpart. His face was made less squared, and his eyes become rounded with plastic eyelids, as opposed to Winchester's flat eyes and fabric eyelids. Like Winchester, Kooser Pasqually was placed behind two doors, a trait which would be shared with Mr. Munch.

## Fate ##
After Kooser upgraded to the Balcony show, Pasqually's whereabouts were unknown. It's assumed he was moved to [Sunnyvale]({{< ref "wiki/Pizza Time Theatre Sunnyvale, CA Corporate Office.md" >}}), but unlike Kooser Chuck E. Cheese (Animatronic) (Chuck E), there are no pictures of him at Sunnyvale. he is currently presumed to have been destroyed when Sunnyvale relocated to [Texas]({{< ref "wiki/Showbiz Pizza Time Corporate Office.md" >}}) after PTT's bankruptancy.,
