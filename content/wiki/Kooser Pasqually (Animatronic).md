**Kooser Pasqually** was the upgraded [\2](\1) used at the opening of the [\2](\1) Pizza Time Theatre in December 1978. It was used until May 1980, when the Portrait Show would be replaced by the [\2](\1)

##  Design ## 
Kooser Pasqually was given a much softer appearance than his Winchester counterpart. His face was made less squared, and his eyes become rounded with plastic eyelids, as opposed to Winchester's flat eyes and fabric eyelids. Like Winchester, Kooser Pasqually was placed behind two doors, a trait which would be shared with Mr. Munch.
