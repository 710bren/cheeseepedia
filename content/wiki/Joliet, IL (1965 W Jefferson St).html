Cheese's</i> that opened on July 13th, 1983 with a Rock-afire Explosion, which got concept unification in 1991/1992 and closed in January 2007 and relocated to the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Joliet, IL (3250 Chicagoland Circle)" >}}">current location</a> on January 29th 2007 as Chuck E. Cheese's with a Studio c Beta and is still open with 2.0.</p>
<p>The store was attached to Kmart #4095 on the left side of the building.</p>
<p><h2> Stages </h2></p>
<p>Joliet opened with a Rock-afire Explosion and later received the Showbiz Pizza Campground Upgrade in 1988-1990. Joliet then got Concept Unification in 1991/1992, removing the Rock-afire Explosion for a 3-Stage. In the early 2000s, the latex masks were replaced with plastic masks. By 2005, the curtains were disabled. Joliet's 3-Stage would stay like this until the January 2007 closure.</p>

<p><h2> History </h2></p>
<p>The Kmart Plaza Jeffreson St was in opened on September 23, 1965 and was 99,310 Square Feet. Before the location opened, the spot was once a Kmart Foods and once Kmart Foods closed, the spot became an A&P groceries store until it was announced that A&P would leave the Chiago market in 1982. The space was used by Kmart for more expansion and the new Showbiz Pizza would take up the other half.</p>
<p>Joliet opened on July 13, 1983 as a Showbiz Pizza Place with the Rock-afire Explosion. Sadly, information on Joliet as a SPP is very scarce. The store itself had a long interior and held more games. In between 1988 and 1990, they received the 1988 remodel removing older decor for new decor, added blue and white awnings on the counters, added checkers inside and outside of the store, and received the Showbiz Pizza Campground Upgrade. In 1991/1992, Joliet fell victim to Concept Unification, changing the Rock-afire Explosion into one of the 150+ 3-Stages. In the mid-late '90s, they received the 1993 remodel, removing all traces of the 1988 remodel, changed the exterior, and changed the decor. Joliet's owners relocated 4.6 miles away to Chicagoland Circle in January 2007. The new location opened on January 29, 2007, but as for the old location, it remained vacant for approximately 15 years. The likely reason why it closed had to do with a rodent infestation, people complaining about how the ball pit smelled awful, and how the rats themselves came from the Kmart. All of this was why they decided to move. The Showroom walls and the SkyTubes lettering was left inside too. In 2011/2012, the building and the Big Kmart next to it was repainted to light colors. The Big Kmart next door would also close on December 11, 2016, leaving the entire Kmart Plaza shuttered. Not long after, the front entrance were boarded up. 2021, Planet Fitness took up the former space. As of November 2023, Planet Fitness is still there.</p>
<p><h2>Animatronics</h2></p>
<p>As previously mentioned, the animatronics from Joliet were sent to Mishawaka, IN. Mishawaka then replaced their original animatronics with Joliet’s, meaning their original animatronics must have been in poor shape and Joliet’s were a lot better. Joliet’s animatronics were in service on Mishawaka’s stage until in 2018, a fire damaged the stage, forcing Mishawaka to get a dance floor. Joliet’s animatronics then were split between multiple stores such as Darien, IL and Chicago Kedzie IL to be used as parts.</p>
