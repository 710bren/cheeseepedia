## Post Closure ##
In June 2020 Layton was one of the 34 locations closed due to Chuck E Cheese declaring for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The building would be gutted and stripped of all Chuck E Cheese branding although the road sign remained until 2021 when the building was turned into a Young Automotive group. The road sign was repainted with the Young Automotive Group logo. After Layton closed it left Salt Lake City as the only CEC in the state of Utah
