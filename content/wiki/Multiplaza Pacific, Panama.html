<p>Multiplaza Pacific Mall, Panama City, Panama is a Chuck E Cheese’s that opened on early 2013 (date unknown) with a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Circles of Light" >}}">Circles of Light</a> stage with a 16M animatronic. It is located on the third floor of Multiplaza Mall.</p>
<p><h2>History</h2></p>
<p>Because of their expansion in Latin America, Chuck E Cheese’s decided to open a location in Panama.</p>
<p>The store opened in 2013 to much fanfare, so much so that a second location opened in 2017.</p>
<p><h2>Exterior and Interior</h2></p>
<p>This location is a very early version of the 2013 Update remodel, having a prototype of the International Mall Entrance, and many things that are not from the 2013 Update, including the “Kids” Posters from the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/CEC 2005 Remodel Program" >}}">2005 Reconfiguration</a>  and the toddler playground from that remodel.</p>
<p>The store also has a checkered wall that is actually a window, looking to the road outside the mall.</p>
