<p><h2>Stages</h2></p>
<p>North Richland Hills opened with the Rock afire Explosion in April 1982. Unfortunately, there are no photos or videos to exist of North Richland Hills with the Rock afire, or as a ShowBiz in general.  Although very little documentation exists back in the ShowBiz days, it can be determined that North Richland Hills was one of several locations to receive an Uncle Klunk show package (and a Santa Claus retrofit package as well) sometime after opening. In January 1985, this location tested the one of a kind <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Country Stage" >}}">Country Stage</a>. Like many ShowBiz locations in the late 1980s, North Richland Hills received the Showbiz Pizza Campground upgrade.</p>
<p>Around 1991, North Richland Hills received <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Concept Unification" >}}">Concept Unification</a> which converted the show to Munch's Make Believe Band, also keeping their SPP valance up to when they would receive a Studio C (1997)|Studio C, in 2000.<ref name=':0'>https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth796171/m1/?q=Chuck%20e%20Cheese</ref></p>
