The <b><i>Animation Programming System (APS) Hardware Setup</b></i> is a collection of devices used by Chuck E. Cheese's to program animatronic shows on the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Animation Programming System" >}}">Animation Programming System</a> software starting in 1990.
APS and its hardware would be a direct upgrade to the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/SongCode" >}}">SongCode</a> programmer and its <a href="{{< ref "wiki/SongCode Hardware Setup" >}}">hardware setup</a>, using many similar concepts and devices.
<h2> Setup </h2>
It is currently unclear what the original hardware is, though the keyboard shown looks to be an IBM Model M keyboard.
