The <b><i>Animation Programming System (APS) Hardware Setup</b></i> is a collection of devices used by Chuck E. Cheese's to program animatronic shows on the [Animation Programming System]({{< ref "wiki/Animation Programming System.md" >}}) software starting in 1990.

APS and its hardware would be a direct upgrade to the [SongCode]({{< ref "wiki/SongCode.md" >}}) programmer and its [hardware setup]({{< ref "wiki/SongCode Hardware Setup.md" >}}), using many similar concepts and devices.

It is currently unclear what the original hardware is, though the keyboard shown looks to be an IBM Model M keyboard.
