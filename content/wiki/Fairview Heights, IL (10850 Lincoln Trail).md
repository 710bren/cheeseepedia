**_10850 Lincoln Trail**_ is a _Showbiz Pizza_/_Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza_ that opened on May 23, 1984 with a [Rock-afire Explosion]({{< ref "wiki/Classic Stage.md" >}}) and is still open today with the 2.0 remodel.

## Stages ##
At first, Fairview Heights had a RAE stage, as it was a Showbiz at the time. Around when Concept Unification came around in 1991/1992, it was replaced by the [3-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/Concept Unification Stage.md" >}}). Around Winter 1997, it was replaced by the [2-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/2-Stage.md" >}}) from the [Waukegan, IL]({{< ref "wiki/Waukegan, IL (2211 Grand Ave).md" >}}) store, which closed around the same time. Around 2000-2003, Chuck's tuxedo was replaced with the Cool Chuck outfit, and later the Avenger outfit, which also disabled curtains. In Fall 2013, the Avenger cap was removed. Around 2019, the stage was removed for a 2019 Model Dance Floor.

## History ##
Fairview Heights opened on May 23, 1984 as a Showbiz Pizza Place and the RAE stage. They later in the late 1980s received the 1988 remodel, which involved removing older decor for new decor, added checkers inside and outside the store, painted the walls, and added neon signage. In 1991/1992, Fairview Heights received Concept Unification, removing all Showbiz decor for newer decor, and removed the RAE for the 3-Stage. Around the mid 90s, they received [Phase 1]({{< ref "wiki/Phase 1 (1994).md" >}})<nowiki/>which involved renovating every aspect of the store. Around Winter 1997, the 3-Stage was removed and replaced with Waukegan's 2-Stage. They later received [Phase 2]({{< ref "wiki/Phase 2 (1997).md" >}}) and [Phase 3]({{< ref "wiki/Phase 3 (2000).md" >}}). In the late 2000s, they received the 2005 update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative, which involved removing all 90s decor for new decor, removing the showroom walls and balcony seating, removed the dim lighting, renovated the exterior facade, and possibly expanded. Around 2019, they received the 2.0 remodel, removing the 2-Stage for a 2019 Model Dance Floor. As of July 2023, Fairview Heights remains like this.
