In 1991/1992, Fairview Heights received Concept Unification, removing all Showbiz decor for newer decor, and removed the RAE for the 3-Stage. Around the mid 90s, they received [\2](\1)<nowiki/>which involved renovating every aspect of the store. Around Winter 1997, the 3-Stage was removed and replaced with Waukegan's 2-Stage.
