 **_8890 E Indian Bend Rd Scottsdale, AZ #85250**_ was a Chuck E. Cheese loacted in Scottsdale, Arizona.

This location opened up as a Chuck E. Cheese in September 1999 and closed in Fall 2009.

##History##
Prior to opening up as a CEC it was a former Leaps and Bounds earlier in the 90s and later closed at an unknown date.

Scottsdale officially opened in September 1999 as a Chuck E. Cheese being the second alpha in the state of Arizona 

It is unknown if Scottsdale ever got the cool chuck outfit since there is basically no documentation at all of this location.

All good things must come to a end when Scottsdale closed in fall 2009 having A amazing 10 year run as the location still remains abandoned to this day with alpha stage still half way intact and the location is used for storage for a nearby school.
