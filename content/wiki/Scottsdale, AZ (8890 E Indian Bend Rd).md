<h2> History </h2>
Scottsdale opened in September 1999 (day unknown) on top of a former Discovery Zone (formerly Leaps and Bounds) with a Studio C (1997) (Studio C Alpha) stage and the [Phase 2]({{< ref "wiki/Phase 2 (1997).md" >}}) remodel. Unfortunately, there is basically no documentation on this store at all, other than a few photos that have been confirmed to originate from this location. The store closed down in Fall 2009 (month and day unknown) due to the relocation of this to Goodyear, AZ. The building remains vacant to this day, and is used for storage by a nearby school, and was slightly expanded recently. It is notable to show that this store is also one of the most intact former stores still in existence, as things such as the Alpha, Blue Screen, panel, and even carpeting, booths, walls, and paneling are still up to this day, despite the exterior being repainted and expanded. The door, while heavily sun damaged, is also still intact.
