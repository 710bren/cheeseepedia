<b><i>Santa Ana, CA</b></i> was a planned <i>Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre</i> for the Santa Ana area in 1979.<ref>PTT Token 134 (B)</ref>

The only evidence of the location's existence comes from a branded token bearing the city's name, PTT Token 134 (B). Notably the token calls it 'Santa Anna'. It is unclear what caused the location to never be built.
