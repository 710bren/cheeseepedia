The Kooser Pizza Time Orchestra was an animatronic produced by <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Fantasy Forest" >}}">Fantasy Forest</a> in 1978 for the 2nd Pizza Time Theatre at <a href="{{< ref "wiki/San Jose, CA (1371 Kooser Rd)" >}}">San Jose, CA (1371 Kooser Rd)</a>.
<h2> History </h2>
The orchestra debuted at the opening of the Kooser Rd location. It had a very similar appearance to <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Winchester Pizza Time Orchestra (Animatronic)" >}}">Winchester's orchestra</a>, although it was housed on a small shelf between Chuck and Jasper instead of all around the show room. It is unknown if the orchestra remained in use after Kooser had the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage" >}}">balcony stage</a> installed or was replaced with the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Drum Board (Cyberamic)" >}}">Drum Board</a>.
