Smartee's Pizza Brigade, also known as Smartee's Parties was a firehouse themed animatronic restaurant made by A. J. Falzone. The chain wasn't open very long unfortunately, as they closed about a year after opening. Their main selling point was about how parents could relax and watch television while their kids could play arcade games supervised.
