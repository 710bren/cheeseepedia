<b><i>SPP Neighbors - Faith - Dreams</b></i> is one of the last few showtapes released for <i>Showbiz Pizza Place's</i> hosting the <i>Rock-afire Explosion</i>.

For some stores, this was the last tape used before <i>Concept Unification</i> would start at their location. Each tape sent after [SPP Christmas '89 / Wave Bday]({{< ref "wiki/SPP Christmas '89  Wave Bday.html" >}}) would become increasingly more rare as stores would convert to <i>3-Stages.</i>

Note: It not comfirm to when this show was released but it was sometime between January or February 1990.
