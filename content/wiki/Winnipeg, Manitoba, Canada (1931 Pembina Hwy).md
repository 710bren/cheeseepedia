It was also the only location in Canada to receive the 1-Stage.
<h2>History</h2>
Winnipeg opened its doors on April 30th, 1990, as the ninth Chuck E. Cheese store in Canada. Unfortunately, there is hardly any documentation of Winnipeg. In 1991, In the early-mid 90's, Winnipeg underwent a minor remodel removing some decor for newer decor and replacing the Rocker Stage for the 1-Stage. Around 1997 or 1998, the location received the so-called 'Phase 2' remodel removing older 90's decor, adding newer decor, another exterior change, and SkyTubes. Around July 2001, the location closed for unknown reasons, most likely due to lease or parking issues. After closure, the store became multiple businesses with the red awning still up until 2008-2009 when it was removed, and the entire building was re-painted. Currently, as of February 2023, the location is still standing although taken up by a business. Now Is A Spa Adress Winnipeg R3T 2G7, 1931 Pembina Hwy.
<h2>Stages</h2>
Originally, Winnipeg featured Chuck E.'s House or the Rocker Stage, as all other Chuck E. Cheese locations had in 1987-1990. Unfortunately, there are a couple photos to exist of Winnipeg with the Rocker Stage (Chuck E.'s House), and 1-Stage as there is only one photo of the location's exterior in general and that would be its exterior and. In July 2001, the location closed and removed their 1-Stage.
