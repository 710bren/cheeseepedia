<p><b><i>Créteil, France (Av. de la France libre, 94000)</b></i> was a Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre that opened on April 5, 1984<sup>[1]</sup> with a Balcony Stage and closed around 1986.</p>
<p>It was the only Chuck E. Cheese in France, being located at the Creteil Soleil Mall.</p>
<p><h2> History </h2></p>
<p>The location would first be mentioned in March 1983, stating it would be open somewhere in France.<sup>[2]</sup> By June, it would be confirmed <i>Jasques Borel International</i> would be handling the location.<blockquote><i>“We are very pleased to be in partnership with this top-ranking leader in international food service, and look forward to opening the first Chuck E. Cheese's center in Paris by the end of the year,”<sup>[3]</sup></i> -Jack Campbell, V.P. of Pizza Time Theatre</blockquote>By December of 1983 however, the '83 opening date would be delayed, with the company now stating the location as just 'coming up'.<sup>[4]</sup> The location would finally open on April 5, 1984 in the Creteil Soleil Mall.</p>
<p>The store would have certain custom merchandise, such as a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Chuck E Cheese Créteil Soleil Pin (1984)" >}}">Chuck E. Cheese Créteil Soleil Pin</a>, alongside the PTT Token 124 (B, NBS). Most things were still their American variants, alongside showtapes and other signage still being in English.</p>
<p>By 1986, the location would close for unknown reasons.</p>
<p><h2> Stages </h2></p>
<p>This store opened with a Balcony Stage, as all other Pizza Time Theatres did. It also had The King in the Lounge, and the 'Rainbow' variant of the  Warblettes.<sup>[5]</sup></p>
