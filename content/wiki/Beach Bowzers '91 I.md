##Production##
Any details about the showtape's production, its filming locations, its video production, anything, goes in here. Be sure to research that any details put in here are for new segments to the tape, as a lot of segments are reused multiple times over a long period. While dates should be given, writing 'which was x months / days from release' next to it will help with understanding the production leading up to its release.

90's showtapes had a lot of painted art used for their segments. Scans, photos, or even just noting all the individual unique art pieces made for the tape should be here.

For all files, whether DVD, Floppy, USB, ect., noting their production dates here is also important, as they are usually months before the tape's release. Any info on APS or similar programming software files, raw footage, ect should also be noted. Master VHS tapes also have their original master dates usually on their label. Tape mastering date should be noted.

CEC Shows made in the 2020's also have live streams from their programmer during the tape's production, any info (preferably citable despite how many aren't recorded) provided during these streams, or just the nature of what part of the programming/video production took place on that day, should be noted.
