**_Beach Bowzers '91 I**_ is a showtape released for the Beagles / Beach Bowsers (Lounge) in March of 1991.
##Production##

### Master Tape ###
The Master SVHS Tape for the show contains no signals, and states '3/11/91' during its intro, likely the date it was mastered. This date matches up with the APS modified dates for its files, which usually correspond to when programming was finished. Due to it being one of the few shows of the time to not contain any video, custom video is provided stating throughout:
 ELEMENT
 MASTER
 BEACH BOWZERS
 
 SONG (Song Number)

### APS Files ###
The show was a part of the [1990-1992 APS Floppy Cases]({{< ref "wiki/1990-1992 APS Floppy Cases.md" >}}), being split across two tapes. Other unrelated files are amongst the disks, such as the Road Stage random movements, [Birthday Star '92]({{< ref "wiki/Birthday Star '92.md" >}}) live for C&R and Road Stages, and the TV intro segment for both Cyberamics and 3-Stage.
