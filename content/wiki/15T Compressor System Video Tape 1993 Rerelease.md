It would be an exact rerelease of the [15T Compressor System Video Tape]({{< ref "wiki/15T Compressor System Video Tape.md" >}}).

## Discovery ##
The only account of the tape's existence comes from an owner of the 1992 release, claiming of another private owner having the rerelease of the tape under the _Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza_ branding on the tape's label.<ref>https://www.instagram.com/p/CeR2CTnp5M36Rgnnrjn2mYNL80CaKGXCUaWYvY0/</ref> This would be further corroborated with the discovery of the late 90's [Ingersoll Rand 15 T Compressor Training Rerelease]({{< ref "wiki/Ingersoll Rand 15 T Compressor Training Rerelease.md" >}}).
