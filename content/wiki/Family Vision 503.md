**_Family Vision #503**_ was part of a collection of monthly Betamax tapes released to _Showbiz Pizza Place_ stores starting in 1986.

The tapes would provide video entertainment to guests during the downtime between showtape segments. The videos would be projected onto a screen that would automatically come down once a show ended. The tapes themselves were charged at $55 a month once a store agreed into the program.

The tapes were produced by _Sight & Sound Entertainment Corporation_, under their _Video Pool_<ref></ref> line. Video Pool had been around on Betamax tapes since March of 1984, published to other vendors, with _Sight & Sound_ being an intermediary for handling the mass tape production and acquisition of copyrighted video material. Each tape would be around 30 minutes long, and were produced until [Cyberstar]({{< ref "wiki/Cyberstar.md" >}}) fully took over all _Showbiz_ locations in late 1989.
