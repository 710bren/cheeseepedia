<h2>History</h2>
Atlanta opened on August 26, 1982 as the seventh Showbiz Pizza Place in Georgia (7th after [[Augusta, GA (3435 Wrightsboro Rd)|Augusta]], [[Macon, GA (3709 Bloomfield Rd)|Macon]], [[Norcross, GA (5019 Jimmy Carter Blvd)|Norcross]], [[Columbus, GA (3201 Macon Rd)|Columbus]], [[Marietta, GA (4340 Roswell Rd)|Marietta]], and [[Tucker, GA (3850 Lavista Rd)|another Atlanta location or rather in Tucker]]) as a corporate-owned store. Atlanta originally featured the Rock-Afire Explosion, as all other Showbiz locations did. they would have it for a few years, until around 1991/1992, when they would receive the 1988 remodel, receiving Concept Unification, where the Rock-Afire Explosion characters were changed to the Chuck E. Cheese characters, and removing all SPP decor for newer decor. In the mid 1990s, Atlanta received a minor remodel removing older CU decor for the Record Posters and Colored Chase Lights. In the year 2000, they would receive the Phase 3 remodel replacing the 3-Stage with a Studio C Alpha, removing older decor for newer decor, and adding SkyTubes. They then received the 2005 update of the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative which involved removing the Showroom Walls, Balcony Seating, adding bright florescent lighting and an exterior repaint. The location was also featured in 'Takin' Care of Business' from the [January 2008 Show]({{< ref "wiki/January 2008 Show.html" >}}). Atlanta would remain like this until February 2023, when they would receive the 2.0 remodel, this involved removing the Studio C Alpha stage and replacing it with a [[Chuck E. Live Stage (Dance Floor)|Dance Floor + Video Wall]]. as of March 2023, Atlanta still has the 2.0 remodel and Dance Floor + Video Wall.

<h2>Stages</h2>
