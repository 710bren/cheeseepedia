## The CEC at 14085 Shoppers Best Way Woodbridge Virginia or 'Dale City' opened on February 15th 1993 with a [2-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/2-Stage.md" >}}). The bots came from an ##
unknown Cyberamics Rocker Stage (Rocker Stage) as Chuck and Helen had PTT movements and Chuck having latex feet. However the store received 2.0 in 2018 due to an 

exterior fire.

## Stages ##
The store opened with a 2 stage that had bots from an unknown Cyberamics Rocker Stage (Rocker Stage). They kept their 2 stage up until March 2018 when an exterior fire damaged the store badly which made them start their 2.0 remodel which lasted roughly 7 months. The 2.0 remodel added the Pizzeria and Games logo, playpass machines, removal of skytubes and stage, and a nicer interior. Dale city was the last Cyberamic store in northern Virginia and the third to last in the state. The final mmbbs in Virginia are [Chesapeake, VA (1528 Sam's Circle)]({{< ref "wiki/Chesapeake, VA (1528 Sam's Circle).md" >}}) and [Richmond, VA (10430 Midlothian Turnpike)]({{< ref "wiki/Richmond, VA (10430 Midlothian Turnpike).md" >}}).
