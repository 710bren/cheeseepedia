<h2> History </h2>
Granada Hills opened sometime in 1983 with the Balcony Stage like other Pizza Time theaters at the time and in the late '80s they possibly could have had the C-Stage though there isn't anything confirming this although this location had the 1988 remodel. Around 1991-1992, they received their Road stage. Sometimes in the mid-90s, They received the Major '90s Remodel along with their 2-Stage. In 2007, they received the 2005 remodel. During this remodel, they destroyed the 2-Stage and installed the Studio C Beta.Â In 2020, this location was forced to shut down due to the pandemic. Unfortunately, this location closed on March 1st, 2021. Everything inside the building was vandalized. The location kept getting vandalized until it was demolished where the building once stood is now an empty field.
