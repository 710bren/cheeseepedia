<b><i>2541-43 El Camino Real</b></i> is a Chuck E. Cheese's that opened on December 28, 1999, and is still open today with a Studio C (1997)|Studio C Alpha.
This location is not to be confused with <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Redwood City, CA (380 Convention Way)" >}}">Redwood City, CA (380 Convention Way)</a>, which opened in August 1981 (day unknown) and closed in February 1986 (day unknown) with a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage" >}}">Balcony Stage</a> and two stories.
Notably, while having 2.0 signs, they do not have anything 2.0 in the interior.
<h2>Stages</h2>
Redwood City opened with a Studio C (1997)|Studio C Alpha. By 2005, the curtains were disabled, in late 2013, Chuck's cap was removed, and by 2022, the bot was no longer programmed. As of September 2024, Redwood City's Alpha still remains like this.

<h2>History</h2>
Redwood City opened on December 28, 1999, on top of a Discovery Zone.
Just like other stores opening at around the time, it originally had <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Phase 2 (1997)" >}}">Phase 2</a>, which included late 90s decor, <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Skytubes" >}}">Skytubes</a>, and the Studio C (1997)|Studio C Alpha stage. It later received <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Phase 3 (2000)" >}}">Phase 3</a>, like other stores. In the late 2000s, this location received (interior only) the 2005 update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative, which involved removing some 90s decor for new decor, tearing down the showroom walls, added purple walls, and threw out older games for newer games and rides. By the late 2010s, the Skytubes were removed for more rides. They would replace their exterior with 2.0 exterior around June 2024. As of September 2024, Redwood City remains like this.
