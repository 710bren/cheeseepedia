The wiki's category system uses **_Tabberneue**_ to categorize sections. 

These are always sectioned into _Pizza Time Theatre, ShowBiz Pizza Place, Chuck E. Cheese's,_ and _Creative Engineering._ If one of the companies doesn't apply to that category (such as Pizza Time Theatre in a Website category), remove that tab. If the tab is otherwise blank from a lack of entries, keep it blank to encourage further contribution.
