<h2>History</h2>
<b><i>4445 SW 110th Ave</b></i> is Beaverton's second <i>Chuck E. Cheese</i> store, following [11753 SW Beaverton Hillsdale]({{< ref "wiki/Beaverton, OR (11753 SW Beaverton Hillsdale).md" >}}), which closed in July 1985. The store opened with the [1988 remodel]({{< ref "wiki/SPT 1988 Remodel Program.md" >}}) and the Chuck E.'s House stage, the last installed in Oregon. The store would later receive the [Phase 2]({{< ref "wiki/Phase 2 (1997).md" >}}) remodel around 1997 to 1999, then Phase 3 in the early 2000's. The store later closed permanently and relocated to 4145 SW 110th Ave. As of July 2023, the land that occupied the store is now part of a Home Depot store.
