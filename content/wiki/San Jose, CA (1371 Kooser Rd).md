**1371 Kooser Rd** was a Pizza Time Theatre that opened on December 2, 1978 as the second Pizza Time Theatre location to open after [San Jose, CA (370 S Winchester Blvd)]({{< ref "wiki/San Jose, CA (370 S Winchester Blvd).md" >}}).  This location was the oldest operating location from when Winchester closed in 1985 until June 25, 2020, when the location permanently closed.

## History ##
TODO: History

## Stages ##
Originally when the store opened, they had the characters in portrait frames, called the Portrait Stage, but Kooser had its own set of bots, different from the Winchester store, and different than the Cyberamic Portrait Stages. they would have this for the next year until May of 1980, when the store would upgrade to Cyberamics and receive the very first Balcony Stage. the store would have the stage for a few years, until the late 80's, when they would receive a C Stage (it is not certain if they had it, but is likely), then sometime in the 1990's they would receive a 2-Stage, where all the characters would receive legs for the very first time, they would have this stage until they closed.
