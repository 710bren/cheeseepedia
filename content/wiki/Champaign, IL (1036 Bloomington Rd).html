<p><b><i>1036 Bloomington Rd</b></i> was a <i>Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre</i> that opened in 1984 with a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage" >}}">Balcony Stage</a> and closed in December 1990 as a <i>ShowBiz Pizza</i> with <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House Facade" >}}">Chuck E.'s House Facade</a>.</p>
<p><h2> History </h2></p>
<p>Champaign opened in 1984 with a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage" >}}">Balcony Stage</a>. However, almost nothing is known about the store at all. The store would get the 1988 remodel and <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House Facade" >}}">Chuck E.'s House Facade</a> in 1989, and rename the store to ShowBiz Pizza in progress. The store closed in December 1990 for unknown reasons. The store would become many businesses, but today, it remains a 'Bargain Bins' discount store.</p>
<p>The building itself still has some remains of when it used to be open- one of the colored checkers can still be seen on the wall under another layer of plaster, and the 'Now Showing' box remains to this day, although boarded up.</p>
<p><h2> Stages and Animatronics </h2></p>
<p>The <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage" >}}">Balcony Stage</a> was kept up until 1989, when they retrofitted it to <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House Facade" >}}">Chuck E.'s House Facade</a>. The stage would only last a year, as they would close in December 1990.</p>

<p>The store would have most likely opened with Helen Henny as a guest star, and a King Cyberamic in the Lounge.</p>
