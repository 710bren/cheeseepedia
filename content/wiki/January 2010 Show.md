<b>January 2010</b> is the winter show released in January 2010, a brand new format for CEC Shows. The AM and PM Schedule which worked for Studio C only. AM reuses the [April 2000]({{< ref "wiki/Just for Kids Show 2000.md" >}}) segments and PM / the existing copies of January 2010 reuse the [April 2005]({{< ref "wiki/CEC TV April 2005 Show.md" >}}) segments. 

This played from January to April 2010. 

<h2>Cyberstar 2.00 Update for Studio C</h2>
This update created contained a provision for initiating an alternate show schedule at a pre-defined time during the day. From the time the show is started until the pre-determined 'swap' time, (Which would be managed by the Entertainment Department) the controller will play shows from the primary schedule. After the 'swap' time has passed, the controller will revert to playing shows from the alternate schedule.<ref>http://www.showbizpizza.com/info/documents/cec/cec_dept18-2010-01.pdf</ref>

<h2> Trivia: </h2>

* This was the only show to use the AM/PM format on Studio C. Starting with April 2010 the system was updated to remove the AM/PM feature but kept the clock on the panel.
* Both Trivia Segments from the AM portion of the show are reused from January 1994 
* BDAY 10 Program/Training are just Birthday 2009 Program/Training but labeled differently for some reason.
