The **_Mini Rock-afire Explosion Stage**_ was a four character show created for five _Showbiz Pizza Place_ locations in 1983.

## History ##
In 1983 Showbiz Pizza proposed that select locations should receive four character shows to Creative Engineering. Aaron Fetcher, owner of Creative Engineering, opposed the idea to install the shows but went through with Showbiz's orders.

In November of 1983 Jim Parrish, the Director of development and Executive Vice President of Showbiz, gave a memo to CEI regarding the shows, stating that Aaron was correct on not wanting to install the shows and that the three stages would be the greater entertainment option. Jim suggests selling the one-stage shows to different customers at an upcoming IAAPA convention. Anderson, IN would be the first to have their show replaced. And the animatronics used on the stages would be used to complete their shows. 

After [Concept Unification]({{< ref "wiki/Concept Unification.md" >}}), CEI would sell Mini shows to different customers.

## Design ##
The one-stage show features Mitzi Mozzarella, Fatz, Billy Bob, and Looney Bird. Behind Mitzi and Fatz is a unique backdrop and tree. Behind Billy Bob and Looney Bird is Smitty's Super Service Station with a new 'Used and Abused Tars' sign.
