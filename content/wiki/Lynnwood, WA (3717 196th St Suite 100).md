**_3717 196th St Suite 100, Store #3173/624**_ was a _Showbiz Pizza Place/Chuck E. Cheese's_ located in Lynnwood, Washington that opened in August 1986, and closed on July 23rd, 2023.

This is not to be confused with the _Pizza Time Theatre_ on Lynnwood, WA (18811 28th Ave) (18811 28th Ave) or the original _Showbiz Pizza Place_ location in the Lynnwood, WA (3815 196th St) (same area). This store was known for having the one of a kind [Cyberamic 3-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/Cyberamic 3-Stage.md" >}}), which was at the location until closure. This was also the only Showbiz Pizza Place location in the Seattle area that made it to [Concept Unification]({{< ref "wiki/Concept Unification.md" >}}), and was the only CEC 3-Stage location in Washington, as the others had closed prior to the early 1990s.

##Stages##
Lynnwood opened with a Rock-afire Explosion stage which was possibly used at the original location. The Rock-afire would remain until the early 1990s when they would receive [Concept Unification]({{< ref "wiki/Concept Unification.md" >}}). By the mid-late '90s, the show fell so far into disrepair, that the characters were replaced entirely with the Cyberamics from the closed [Spokane]({{< ref "wiki/Spokane, WA (2301 W Wellesley Ave).md" >}}) store in the year 2000, utilizing both 3-Stage and [2-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/2-Stage.md" >}}) props on their unique show. 

The store was most notable for keeping the original Jasper cosmetic head used at the Spokane store during the 1980s; and for being the first and last of its kind, after the [Springfield, MA (Boston Rd)]({{< ref "wiki/Springfield, MA (1716 Boston Rd).md" >}}) had a similar short-lived concept. Beginning as early as July 19th, 2023 during the store’s last days of operation, the Chuck E. animatronic was aired down<ref> https://youtu.be/P5jWGLGoklY</ref>, although Chuck was turned on for the final day, on July 23rd, 2023.

## History##
The Lynnwood, WA store opened in August of 1986 after the closure of the Lynnwood, WA (3815 196th St) (original store). This would later become the last operating Showbiz Pizza Place in Washington state, as the Bellevue, WA (15600 NE 8th St) (Bellevue) and Seattle, WA (3605 34th St South) (Seattle) locations never made it past the 1980s. This was the last operating Former Showbiz Pizza Place in Washington State and is the only one that was converted into a Chuck E Cheese.  

At an unknown point in time, the store received the standard 1986 SPT remodel and most likely received signage from the Lynnwood, WA (18811 28th Ave) (18811 28th Ave) PTT store around the [Concept Unification]({{< ref "wiki/Concept Unification.md" >}}) transitional period. The store would receive its third and final remodel in the 1990s. On July 5, 2010, Lynnwood was brought out by corporate along with the [Tacoma]({{< ref "wiki/Tacoma, WA (4911 Tacoma Mall Blvd).md" >}}) location, another CEC in Washington State. Sometime in the mid 2010s, some 1990s art was removed and replaced with newer Phase 4 wall art, but kept some 90s decor, like a few '91 Confetti posters, the '93 Sepia Tone poster, and their Must C TV award posters in the showroom. 

### Closure ###
This location closed permanently on July 23rd, 2023, after 32 years in operation as a Chuck E. Cheese and 37 years in operation overall, including their operation as a Showbiz Pizza. The most likely reason why the location closed because the store's lease was up, and the owners of the building wanted to demolish the building so they could construct new condos on the property. After closure, it appeared that management was making an effort to clear out the building, as many boxes in the showroom and game areas were seen.<ref>https://youtu.be/65moOuaAWd8</ref> On August 20, 2023, the animatronic characters and pieces artwork were loaded onto a Penske truck. Some artwork was saved and sent to the SPT Distribution Warehouse/Corporate, as some were destroyed and thrown into the dumpsters. 
The building was completely gutted on August 23. It is unknown if the Phase 3 awnings will be removed. Currently, as of March 2024, the building is still standing. It's likely the building will not be torn down now because it also houses another tenant aside from the former Chuck E. Cheese, Slater Insurance School. It is possible that when that business' lease runs out and they close their good, the building will finally be demolished.
