## History ##
### Showbiz ###

This store originally began as a Showbiz Pizza Place on October 1st, 1982  with The Rock-afire Explosion.

### Tux Chuck and Cool Chuck Eras ###
In the 90's, Lynnwood underwent Concept Unification, and The Rock-afire was replaced by Munch's Make Believe Band, complete with all of the characters including extras such as Building, Moon, Wink, Pizzacam, and Munch Jr. Chuck E. wore his signature black tuxedo and red derby hat. In 2000, the animatronics were replaced with Cyberamics from the [Spokane, WA (2301 W Wellesley Ave)]({{< ref "wiki/Spokane, WA (2301 W Wellesley Ave).md" >}}) location (Which relocated to [Spokane, WA (10007 N Nevada St)]({{< ref "wiki/Spokane, WA (10007 N Nevada St).md" >}}) with a [Studio C Alpha]({{< ref "wiki/Studio C Alpha.md" >}})) which they still have to this day.

### Present Day ###
The store features a Cyberamic 3-Stage (With many changes made to it over the years) with Phase 3 & Phase 4 store art.
