<b>Pizza Wars</b> was a poster created for <i>Showbiz Pizza</i> and <i>Chuck E. Cheese's</i> in <i>1988</i>.

<h2>Production</h2>
This poster was one of the few Rock-Afire Explosion parody posters released in 1988. Once [Concept Unification]({{< ref "wiki/Concept Unification.html" >}}) began this poster would cease production in 1990.

This poster has been re-released by Creative Engineering after Concept Unification after mass fanfare for the Rock-afire Explosion has been ignited in the 2000s.<ref>https://creativeengineering.bigcartel.com/</ref>

The poster is a parody of the [https:<i>en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_(film) Star Wars] movie poster from 1977.<ref>https:</i>filmartgallery.com/products/star-wars-9859</ref>

This piece details Duke LaRue as Luke Skywalker, Mitzi Mozzarella as Princess Leia, Billy Bob and Beach Bear as C-3PO and R2-D2.
