##Stage##
This location is the second to last Studio C Beta to be installed with a  and is also speculated to have the oldest Studio C Animatronic on a Studio C Beta. 

The Chuck E. Cheese Animatronic was installed incorrectly onto to show which lead to its eyelids being stuck upwards and for the head to be stuck tilted for years. The Show itself was updated at some point from 2017 to 2020 to have LED lighting; at the same time, new fur arms, jeans, feet, and miscellaneous repairs for the Chuck E. Animatronic. 

##History##

### Artwork ###
The Melvin franchise locations received 'Star Stage' Artwork in 2010 that would end up replacing what ever was in the showroom. This caused this locations 'Kids Posters' to have the shortest time displayed in a location.
