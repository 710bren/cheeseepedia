Hiya, I'm CEC1988, I enjoy many things, CEC Being one of them, That was my first interest, I have a passion for CEC since 2013, The first location I visited Was <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Garden Grove, CA (13101 Harbor Blvd)" >}}">Garden Grove, CA</a> way back in April 2013(I missed the CECP Logo in 2011 :( lol can't blame myself ) I'm 13 Irl, My Most Visited Location is <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Chino, CA (5250 Philadelphia St)" >}}">Chino, CA</a> Which I've visited since 2014 when I moved, Hence why I have 1988 in my Profile name. Chino is really underrated, it housed the first <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House" >}}">Rocker Stage</a> in California, and was A Showbiz Pizza! I always wanted to see a 3-Stage (for some reason I thought <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Diamond Bar, CA (1900 S Brea Canyon Rd)" >}}">Diamond Bar, CA</a> Housed one lol). I want to own a Cyberamic Chuck. E. one day, Maybe when a location remodels, I know Cyberstar Chuck Reserved <a href="{{< ref "wiki/La Mesa, CA (5500 Grossmont Center Dr)" >}}">La Mesa</a> So that only leaves me Huntington Beach!

I edit with what I can, I know Chino a lot because I have friends which have pictures of Chino when they were Young, That's why i could confirm that they had the Chuck E Cheese Pizza Logo like La Mesa's until 1996, Bu- Hmm I should change something..
So recently I got the Wink From <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Diamond Bar, CA (1900 S Brea Canyon Rd)" >}}">Diamond Bar</a>, Someone was selling a Wink For Dirt Cheap at a garage Sale, they said they didn't want it anymore and that they got it near a CEC in Diamond Bar, so I bought it! I wont be posting pictures of the Wink Right now. I need to restore him! :)
Have a Chuck. E. Day!!!
