<p>Hi I am Rooflunar, and I am a very avid CEC and Rockafire Fan. Though I am no longer active on Cheeseepedia due to a ton of false information being used on pages and people abusing their power on this website.</p>
<p>you can now find me on the Chuck E. Cheeseâ€™s university wiki where real information and fairness will happen.</p>
<p>My goal with Cheeseepedia is to help make this wiki more complete for people who are just learning about the Fandom.</p>
