Hello, I'm a animatronic fan who mostly focuses on the Chuck E. Cheese's side of the community. I started getting interested in Chuck E. Cheese's at a very early age during the late 2000's - early 2010's via watching YouTube videos about the animatronic shows, locations, and the history. In 2018, I started documenting the locations in the Houston Texas area on my YouTube page. Now I'm willing to help Cheese-E-Pedia on preserving the history of all things Chuck E. Cheese's & Showbiz Pizza Place.
