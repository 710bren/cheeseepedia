<h2>= Stuff That Is Neat </h2>=

* [Kooser Location]({{< ref "wiki/San Jose, CA (1371 Kooser Rd).md" >}}) (so cool)

* Showtapes (the lifeblood of animatronics)
* New Data (starving for cool shit)
* New Showtape Signals (a religious experience)

<h2>= Stuff I Need </h2>=

* An animatronic in my house (don't look outside your window)
* An Chuck E. Cheese's Computer Learning Center (Androbot), Hubot, or Marvin Mark I (my wallet is ready)
