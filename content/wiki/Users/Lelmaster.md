Hello! I'm Lelmaster! I've been interested in animatronics since about 2017 when I first found out there were more animatronic bands out there than just Freddy and the band lmao. 

I joined this wiki to move my wiki about Sgt. Singer's to a more animatronic focused wiki page, but I also hope I'll be able to help contribute much more to the wiki in the future!

If you would like to contact me I respond fasted via discord (lelmaster) and my email (lelmasterbusiness@gmail.com). 


Here's also my current social links I may or may not update.
