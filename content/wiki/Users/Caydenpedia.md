## About Me ##
Hey there! I'm Caydenpedia! I'm a young editor on Cheese-E-Pedia who adds stuff or fixes mistakes on Chuck E. Cheese/Showbiz Pizza articles. I also have a Wikipedia account with the same name. My Wikipedia account was created in March 2020. I created this account on September 20, 2023. In real life, I'm 14 years old and reside in Raleigh, North Carolina, and the [Chuck E. Cheese location]({{< ref "wiki/Raleigh, NC (3501-131 Capital Blvd).md" >}}) in that city is my hometown location. 

## Chuck E. Cheese's (2013-present day) ##
I have been to three CEC locations in North Carolina, the [Capital Blvd]({{< ref "wiki/Raleigh, NC (3501-131 Capital Blvd).md" >}}) location in Raleigh since 2013, the [Mayfair St]({{< ref "wiki/Durham, NC (3724 Mayfair St).md" >}}) location in Durham since 2023, and the [Sutters Creek Blvd]({{< ref "wiki/Rocky Mount, NC (730 Sutters Creek Blvd).md" >}}) location in Rocky Mount once around 2017 or 2018. I am very passionate about CEC and have been going to their locations for a long time. I've been interested in the community full time since early 2023. The oldest time I went to a location was in Raleigh back in 2013 when I was around 2 or 3 years old. The Raleigh location is my local store that I've been going to for years. It's only 6-7 minutes away from me. Everything changed in August 2022 when they got their 2.0 remodel and removed their stage. I didn't know about it until my visit in April 2023. I still visit occasionally and I still support my local store, but not as much as I used to due to them having 2.0. The latest times I been to the Raleigh CEC was on September 25, 2022, April 2, 2023, and October 14, 2023. I have been to the Durham location three times since July 8, 2023. And then again on July 30 and November 25. That location has thankfully not been remodeled yet.

Also here's a countdown tier list of my Top 10 Least/Most Favorite current CEC Stage types from 1989 to 2020. Others would start at one, but I'm start counting at the end.

10. Chuck E. Live Stage (Dance Floor) (Chuck E. Live Stage) & [Video Wall]({{< ref "wiki/Video Wall.md" >}}) (placed at the end because it's mediocre)

9. [Studio C Cappa]({{< ref "wiki/Studio C Cappa.md" >}}) (was at my third local store until 2023)

8. [Studio C Beta]({{< ref "wiki/Studio C Beta.md" >}}) (16M or 32M)

7. [Circles of Light]({{< ref "wiki/Circles of Light.md" >}}) (16M, 32M, or no bot)

6. [2-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/2-Stage.md" >}}) (the backdrops on the center stage are too close to each other, like the MMBB sign and the brick wall; still a decent stage though)

5. [Concept Unification 1-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/Concept Unification 1-Stage.md" >}}) (it is a unique test show concept in my opinion)

4. [Cyberamics Road Stage]({{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Road Stage.md" >}}) (the half-bodied bots give me 1980s Pizza Time Theatre vibes, in a good way)

3. [Studio C Alpha]({{< ref "wiki/Studio C Alpha.md" >}}) (a nice looking late night themed stage)

2. [1-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/1-Stage.md" >}}) (well layed out and has been at my 2nd local store since 1994, and that rhymes)

1. [Concept Unification Stage]({{< ref "wiki/Concept Unification Stage.md" >}}) (was at my local store until August 2022)

I also have my own Chuck E. Cheese collection, consisting of cups from Durham, Sketch Book photos, and an official CEC Funko Pop. I've been a CEC fan since 2021 and a community member since early 2023. I also have a YouTube channel, Cheddar Chuck E. That's where I post my Chuck E. Cheese / Showbiz Pizza videos. Here's a link to it: https://www.youtube.com/@showbizcheesenc3956

That's it for my personal page, cya.
