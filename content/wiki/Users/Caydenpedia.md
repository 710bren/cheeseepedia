Hey there! I'm Caydenpedia! I'm a young editor on Cheese-E-Pedia who adds stuff or fixes mistakes on Chuck E. Cheese/Showbiz Pizza articles. I also have a Wikipedia account with the same name. My Wikipedia account was created in March 2020. I created this account on September 20, 2023. In real life, I'm 13 years old and I live in Raleigh, North Carolina. 

I have visited three CEC locations in the area, the Capital Boulevard location in Raleigh from 2013 to 2023, the Mayfair Street location in Durham since 2023, and the Sutter's Creek Boulevard location in Rocky Mount once around 2017. I am passionate about CEC and have been going to their locations for a while. The oldest time I went to a location was in Raleigh back in 2013 when I was 3. The Raleigh location was my local store that I went for years until August 2022 when they would get the cancerous 2.0 remodel. The last times I went to Raleigh's CEC was on September 25, 2022 and April 2, 2023. After those visits, I have decided to not go to the Raleigh location anymore since they received 2.0 and removed their animatronics. I have been to the Durham location twice in 2023. That location has not been remodeled yet, thank goodness.

Well that's it, thanks for viewing this article!
