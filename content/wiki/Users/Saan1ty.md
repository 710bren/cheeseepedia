Hello, I'm saan1ty and I'm a Chuck E. Cheese and Showbiz fan. (As a lot of people here likely are.)
My local Chuck E. Cheese's is Durham, NC. If you have any old pictures of them give them to me on Discord at saan1ty#3252 lol.
I have been to Billy Bob's Wonderland.
The oldest piece of merchandise I own is a 1990 CEC token.
**I was banned from the Discord server being 14 instead of 16**, cause that is apparently **too young** I assume, and _since I'm saying this I'm sure I'll be banned from here momentarily too._ I didn't do anything wrong in the server, and Chuck E. Cheese, the company, is designed for children, and anyway Discord's minimum age is 13, not 16. If you think that because people like me who aren't 16 are too 'immature' to handle a pizza place arcade then, you're wrong.

**If you are going to keep your rule, I will see you back in your server on June 9, 2025. The day I turn 16...**

I'm probably just going to lurk around on this wiki, I might add some of my old pictures of Durham or my BBWL pictures, and do general edits and fixes maybe... if I'm here to do it that is.
