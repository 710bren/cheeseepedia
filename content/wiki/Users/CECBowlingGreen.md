If I do get a personal email sometime in the future, I will possibly think about uploading footage I have of different stores I've been to in 2022. (I don't have too much footage from years before). I also have a [https://open.spotify.com/user/brennanw0924 Spotify account] if you wanna check out the playlists I've made.
