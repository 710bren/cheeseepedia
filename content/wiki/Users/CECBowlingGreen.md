Hi! I'm Brennan, I'm a Chuck E. Cheese fan who lives in Bowling Green, Kentucky. My local location is the CEC in Bowling Green and they have recently remodeled as of July 2022! the animatronic Chuck E. (they had a Studio C Cappa, the only one in kentucky) was removed when I went to check on the remodel. I have been to 17 different CEC's. 3 in Kentucky (Bowling Green, Louisville, and Paducah) 2 in Wisconsin (Green Bay and Grand Chute/Appleton) 2 in Arkansas (Little Rock and North Little Rock) 3 in California (La Mesa, San Diego, and Foothill Ranch) 1 in Illinois(Villa Park) 6 in Tennessee(Mt. Juliet, Franklin, Clarksville, Cordova, Antioch, and Madison) I have liked Chuck E. Cheese for years the first one I went to was in Green Bay, Wisconsin and I have been to a lot more in recent years (I think I started really getting into it in maybe 2017. I would like to get a job at my local, even if they're remodeled, I don't care, it's still Chuck E. Cheese and besides I think their remodel looks nice. This is probably super long but I am fine with it lol.
