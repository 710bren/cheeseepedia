## Welcome ##
[[File:Arg-6-50-trans.gif|right]][[File:Arg-4-50-trans.gif|right]]I'm The 64th Gamer, creator of the RR Engine, a showtape archivist, and enthusiast.<blockquote>Total Wiki Changes Made: **{{#cscore:The 64th Gamer|changes}}**</blockquote>

### Stuff That Is Neat ###

* [Kooser Location]({{< ref "wiki/San Jose, CA (1371 Kooser Rd).md" >}}) (so cool)

* Showtapes (the lifeblood of animatronics)
* New Data (starving for cool shit)
* New Showtape Signals (a religious experience)

### Stuff I Need ###

* An animatronic in my house (don't look outside your window)
* An Chuck E. Cheese's Computer Learning Center (Androbot), Hubot, or Marvin Mark I (my wallet is ready)
* More Showtapes (ebay don't fail me now)

### Stuff That Needs To Be Found Right NOW ###

* [Strike It Up]({{< ref "wiki/Strike It Up.md" >}}) with signals (unlikely ever)
* [Kooser showtape]({{< ref "wiki/Kooser Main Show & Dolli Showtape.md" >}}) in full (possible in 10 years)
* [CU Premiere]({{< ref "wiki/SPP Concept Unification Premiere.md" >}}) signals (only if Corp blesses us)
* SPP Rolfe & Earl/Bday Wave (SPP Rolfe & Earle) signals (impossible)
