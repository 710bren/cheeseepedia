## What’s up cool kids! ##
 What’s up? I’m Pach. I like adding pictures and adding info of locations. My favourite CEC era is Tux Chuck.

## Where am I from? ##
 I was born in the Muskoka area of Ontario, Canada. My family and I moved to Maryland in 2015. I love both of my homelands dearly. Here’s a picture right on the Lake of Bays, a 5 minute walk from my Canadian home. [[File:Lake of Bays sunset.jpg|thumb|Sunset on the Lake of Bays in Muskoka]]
