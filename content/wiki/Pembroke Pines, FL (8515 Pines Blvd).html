<p><h2>History</h2></p>
<p>Pembroke Pines opened on September 11th, 1991, as a corporate-owned location. Pembroke Pines opened with the 1988 Remodel including the CU decor, and the Road Stage. Around the mid-late 1990's, They replaced the logo with Coach Chuck and removed older 90's decor for newer decor and the removal of the ball pit for SkyTubes. Around 2007-2008, Pembroke Pines remodeled to the 2005 update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative which involved the removal of the showroom walls, removing older decor for newer decor, new booths, & adding purple walls. Pembroke Pines remained like this until April 2022 when they received the 2.0 remodel and removed the Road Stage for the Dance Floor. Currently, as of February 2023, the location still has the 2.0 Remodel and the Dance Floor.</p>
