The **'F.R.I.E.N.D.Z' (Must C TV Award)** was a poster created for Chuck E. Cheese in 1998.

##  Design ## 
This poster features a parody of TV Show 'Friends', it has Jasper T. Jowls, Mr. Munch, Chuck E. Cheese, Helen Henny, and Pasqually all sitting down on the couch watching a birthday cake.

##  Size/Dimensions ## 
Like the other 'Must C TV' posters, this was made larger than actual TV posters, so it'd be cheaper and easier to retrofit the Phase 2 'record posters' with them.

##  Reception ## 
The poster originally received generally positive reception upon release, however, as time passed, it began to get a more negative reception, with many critics of the Original Phase Trilogy using this as a literal poster child for showing how dated pre-2005 Chuck E. Cheese's stores are. Nowadays, it does have a cult following, either due to how absurd the poster is, or due to the 90s nostalgia boom.
