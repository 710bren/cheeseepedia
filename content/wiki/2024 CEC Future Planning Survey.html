The <b><i>2024 Chuck E. Cheese Future Planning Survey</b></i> was a survey released on March 25, 2024 asking customers and fans of Chuck E. Cheese's their thoughts on the future plans for the company, concluding with thousands of submissions from the community.<ref>https://surveys.chuckecheese.com/s3/LRP2024</ref>

The survey focused on four major areas: opinions on the Munch's Make Believe Band Residency at <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Northridge, CA (8425 Reseda Blvd)" >}}">Northridge, CA (8425 Reseda Blvd)</a>, 5 different options for a differently themed CEC location- with one including an expanded version of the Residency, opinions on a CEC Fan Club with exclusive offerings, and what the company should do to celebrate its 50th anniversary in 2027.

<h2> History </h2>
Chuck E. Cheese would experience financial hardship in 2023, causing cuts to their new menu items- which at the time were consistently around 5 per year, a cut to programming for new shows, and stores closing. This culminated in the December 2023 report of CEC's parent company looking to sell the brand and its assets.<ref>https:<i>www.reuters.com/markets/deals/restaurant-chain-chuck-e-cheese-explores-sale-sources-2023-12-15/</ref> CEC would do a few marketing pushes around the same time, being of the 'New Adult Menu'<ref>https:</i>www.restaurantdive.com/news/chuck-e-cheese-grown-up-menu/702778/</ref> and a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/, Australia" >}}">planned location in Australia.</a> News from the company however would severely die down by the end of January.

On March 25, 2024 at 5:02PM CDT, <i>Mark Kupferman</i>, a recent hire from November 2023 as the new Chief Insights and Marketing Officer<ref>https:<i>www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cec-entertainment-appoints-mark-kupferman-as-new-chief-insights--marketing-officer-for-chuck-e-cheese-brand-301977544.html</ref>, would make a post to the <i>r/chuckecheese</i> subreddit titled 'Planning Survey from Chuck E. Cheese'<ref>https:</i>www.reddit.com/r/chuckecheese/comments/1bnqhvg/planning_survey_from_chuck_e_cheese/</ref>. The post would note:<blockquote>'As we embark on an exciting phase of long-range planning, your insights as dedicated fans are incredibly important to us. We're exploring new ideas and would love to hear your thoughts.'</blockquote>This would be the only place the survey would be posted, signaling to have it reach outside the general customer base and extent to communities and fans of the brand. While the reddit post itself did not gain much traction, the survey would quickly be spread throughout the animatronics community over the next following days.

<h2>= Closure </h2>=

The survey would conclude some time around 5PM CDT on March 27th, 2024, giving exactly a 2 day opening window for submissions. The new message on the webpage would state:<blockquote>'Thank you so much for coming to our survey! We received thousands of great, thoughtful responses and we very much appreciate everyone's participation. We're sorry we missed your feedback this time around, but we plan to be conducting additional surveys soon!'</blockquote>By the closure, the original Reddit post still only had 33 upvotes and 48 comments. Most of the submissions came directly from word of mouth.

While the exact count of responses nor any analytics were released, many public posts about taking the survey suggest most users picked the themed location to be retro themed, alongside the choice for other animatronics displays to be <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Billings, MT (100 24th St)" >}}">Billings, MT (100 24th St)</a>, <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Hicksville, NY (Delco Plaza 11-15 Hanover Place)" >}}">Hicksville, NY (Delco Plaza 11-15 Hanover Place)</a>, <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Springfield, IL (2369 McArthur Ave)" >}}">Springfield, IL (2369 McArthur Ave)</a>, and <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Charlotte, NC (7701 Pineville-Matthews Rd)" >}}">Charlotte, NC (7701 Pineville-Matthews Rd)</a>.<ref>https:<i>www.reddit.com/r/chuckecheese/comments/1bnqhvg/planning_survey_from_chuck_e_cheese/</ref><ref>https:</i>www.youtube.com/post/UgkxVDxAu5rrg1A427AP_ZYvcXraybQwjD3I</ref><ref>https:<i>www.youtube.com/channel/UCT51H7zhGxVfuuUvY3lGX4w/community?lb=UgkxD5ybtp1H5NQrQUvgmfoPDPpCTgt120PR</ref><ref>https:</i>www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIf-gG2MZI0</ref><ref>https://www.reddit.com/r/Animatronics/comments/1bo0rtp/chuck_e_cheese_survey/</ref>

The survey would re-open at an unknown time around March 29-30th, continuing to allow submissions. No statement announced the reopening. It would close again sometime within the week.

<h2>= Page 7 </h2>=
<blockquote>What unique and interesting theme would you like to see for a Chuck E. Cheese location?

# <b>Retro Chuck E. Cheese (1980-1990s):</b> Experience the magic of Chuck E. Cheese with a nostalgic twist! Imagine arcade classics, iconic games, memorable Chuck E. memorabilia, and a menu inspired by fan favorites. Relive the glory days with themed parties, retro music, and an ambiance that takes you straight back to the best of the 80s and 90s.
# <b>Outdoor Camping Chuck E. Cheese:</b> Enjoy a simulated outdoor camping experience indoors. Think artificial trees, tent-like play areas, and a campfire setting, complete with camping-themed games and snacks.
# <b>Educational Chuck E. Cheese:</b> Engage with learning-based games and activities. A great concept for educational enrichment, but a departure from the classic Chuck E. Cheese entertainment-focused model.
# <b>Artistic Studio Chuck E. Cheese:</b> Explore creativity with art-themed activities and digital art stations. While innovative, this theme focuses more on quiet creativity than the active, engaging fun associated with Chuck E. Cheese.
# <b>Futuristic Chuck E. Cheese:</b> Step into a future-focused Chuck E. Cheese, with advanced tech games that are more about virtual reality and less about the physical play that defines the Chuck E. Cheese experience.

Why do you prefer the theme you selected?
