The <b><i>Rock-afire Explosion</b></i> was an animatronic show created by [Creative Engineering]({{< ref "wiki/Creative Engineering.html" >}}) for [ShowBiz Pizza Place]({{< ref "wiki/ShowBiz Pizza Place.html" >}}) from 1980 to 1983, which would be used in its restaurants until ShowBiz Pizza Time started [Concept Unification]({{< ref "wiki/Concept Unification.html" >}}) from 1990 to 1992.

Most remaining Rock-afire shows were turned into Chuck E. Cheese [[3-Stage|3-Stages]], which are also being dwindled down due to the [CEC 2018 2.0 Remodel Program]({{< ref "wiki/CEC 2018 20 Remodel Program.html" >}}).Creative Engineering would continue to use its spare shows to sell to family entertainment centers as-is, [[Moonrockers|retrofitted]], or with new additions such as video and karaoke throughout the 80's and 90's.

<h2> History </h2>
The Rock-afire Explosion would first be developed in April of 1980, before debuting at the [Jacksonville, FL (9820 Atlantic Blvd)]({{< ref "wiki/Jacksonville, FL (9820 Atlantic Blvd).html" >}}) on August 14th of that year. The characters were based off the [Wolf Pack 5]({{< ref "wiki/Wolf Pack 5.html" >}}) animatronic show Creative Engineering had previously developed.
