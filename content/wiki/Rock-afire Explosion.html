The <b><i>Rock-afire Explosion</b></i> was an animatronic show created by <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Creative Engineering" >}}">Creative Engineering</a> for <a href="{{< ref "wiki/ShowBiz Pizza Place" >}}">ShowBiz Pizza Place</a> from 1980 to 1983, which would be used in its restaurants until ShowBiz Pizza Time started <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Concept Unification" >}}">Concept Unification</a> from 1990 to 1992.

Most remaining Rock-afire shows were turned into Chuck E. Cheese 3-Stage|3-Stages, which are also being dwindled down due to the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/CEC 2018 20 Remodel Program" >}}">CEC 2018 2.0 Remodel Program</a>.Creative Engineering would continue to use its spare shows to sell to family entertainment centers as-is, <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Moonrockers" >}}">retrofitted</a>, or with new additions such as video and karaoke throughout the 80's and 90's.

<h2> History </h2>

The characters were based off the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Wolf Pack 5" >}}">Wolf Pack 5</a> animatronic show Creative Engineering had previously developed.
