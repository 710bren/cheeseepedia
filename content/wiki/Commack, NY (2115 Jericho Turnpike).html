<b><i>2115 Jericho Turnpike, Store #504</b></i> was a <i>Chuck E. Cheese's</i> located in Commack, New York.
The location opened on January 23, 1995, and closed on June 14, 2015<sup>(1)</sup>. This location should not be confused with Commack, NY (6137 Jericho Turnpike) which was a Pizza Time Theatre location that was open from 1983-1987.
<h2>Stages</h2>
This location opened with a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/1-Stage" >}}">1-Stage</a> show, which featured a turntable for Chuck E.
In 2005, the showroom was relocated from the back left-hand corner of the restaurant to the right-hand side of the restaurant which can be seen upon entry. In the process, the existing stage was replaced with a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Studio C Cappa" >}}">Studio C Cappa</a>.
<h2>History</h2>
The location's first major known renovation was in 2005, when the showroom was swapped with the game room and showroom walls were removed as a result.

Upon its closure, the location was converted into a Bar Louie. In 2019, the Bar Louie ceased operations; the location is currently a funeral home.<sup>(3)</sup>
