<b><i>2115 Jericho Turnpike, Store #504</b></i> was a <i>Chuck E. Cheese's</i> located in Commack, New York. 

The location opened on January 23, 1995, and closed on June 14, 2015<ref>https://www.newsday.com/business/chuck-e-cheese-s-in-commack-closed-after-losing-lease-r99564</ref>. This location should not be confused with Commack, NY (6137 Jericho Turnpike) which was a Pizza Time Theatre location that was open from 1983-1987.
<h2>Stages</h2>
This location opened with a [1-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/1-Stage.html" >}}) show, which featured a turntable for Chuck E. 

In 2005, the showroom was relocated from the back left-hand corner of the restaurant to the right-hand side of the restaurant which can be seen upon entry. In the process, the existing stage was replaced with a [Studio C Cappa]({{< ref "wiki/Studio C Cappa.html" >}}).
<h2>History</h2>
The location's first major known renovation was in 2005, when the showroom was swapped with the game room and showroom walls were removed as a result.

In 2013, the restaurant was also featured in local news for a brawl that erupted in the Kid Check area.<ref>https://longisland.news12.com/police-brawl-theft-at-commack-chuck-e-cheeses-34750256</ref>

Upon its closure, the location was converted into a Bar Louie. In 2019, the Bar Louie ceased operations; the location is currently a funeral home.<ref>https://libn.com/2021/09/14/former-commack-watering-hole-to-become-funeral-parlor/</ref>
