**Methuen, MA (90 Pleasant Valley Rd)** is a Chuck E. Cheese's location that opened in 2000. 

## History ##
Prior to CEC opening, the space was the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Loop_(shopping_center) Methuen Mall], and was redeveloped in 2000 as The Loop, an open air strip mall.

Methuen officially opened August 28th, 2000, with a [Studio C Alpha]({{< ref "wiki/Studio C Alpha.md" >}}). 

In 2005, Methuen disabled their curtains, before re-enabling them in 2007. They swapped out Late Night for the Avenger outfit between 2009-2011, while keeping the original cap. By the end of September 2013, the Late Night/Cool Chuck cap was removed. 

In November 2014, Methuen began their remodel to the 2013 Update, along with the store in Everett, Massachusetts. The Blue Screen camera was also removed by this time. In 2016, the curtains were disabled yet again. In early 2017, the [Interactive Console]({{< ref "wiki/Interactive Console.md" >}}) was removed, marking the extinction of the console in New England. Since then, no major changes have been made to the Alpha.
