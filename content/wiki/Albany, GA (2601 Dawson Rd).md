##  History ## 
Albany opened on December 16, 2003 with the Phase 3 remodel and a [\2](\1). Unfortunately, there isn't much info on Albany from around this time. In 2010, Albany received the [\2](\1), removing the dim lighting, added purple walls, added newer decor, and added checkers around the logo around the exterior. Albany would remain like this until July 2023, when Albany received the 2.0 remodel, removing the [\2](\1) for a 2021 Model [\2](\1) and [[Video Wall]]. This would remodel would make Georgia bot-less. As of August 2023, Albany is still undergoing this process.
