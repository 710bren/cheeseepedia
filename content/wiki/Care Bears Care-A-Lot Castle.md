The **_Care Bears: Care-A-Lot Castle**_ was a Sally animatronic show produced in 1987, becoming the first official show of the company's to utilize intellectual properties (after a previous attempt was made to adapt The Berenstain Bears for an IAAPA display).

Only installed in two venues worldwide, it was a very short lived endeavor that ended up lasting for just around five years. However, this instance would lay the foundation for Sally's future work with intellectual properties and established brands.

## Historical Background ##

### Development ###
In 1986, while production on Nelvana Studios' _[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Care_Bears_Family Care Bears Family]_ was underway, Sally Industries obtained a license from American Greetings and Nelvana to develop an animatronic stage show based on the _Care Bears_ franchise. Under the leadership of Sally, the show was produced in-house at their Jacksonville facilities and with no involvement from the crew behind the animated series.

Janet Sherman, who had been heavily involved with Sally's animated shows by that point, would once again spearhead the script writing and soundtrack editing. All music and vocals were recorded at the Jacksonville-based Warehouse Studios, where soundtracks for , _[Gwen and the Magical Music Makers]({{< ref "wiki/Gwen and the Magical Music Makers.md" >}})_, and other Sally shows of the 1980's were produced. At Warehouse, several new songs written specifically for the show were recorded in conjunction with repurposed songs from the aforementioned _Dixie Diggers_ and _Magical Music Makers_ shows (including the _Brazzle Dazzle Day_ song from the 1977 _[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete%27s_Dragon_(1977_film) Pete's Dragon]_ film by Walt Disney Productions).

### Installations ###
The first of the two _Care-A-Lot_ installations was located at [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancol_Dreamland Dunia Fantasi], an Indonesian theme park, and officially premiered under the name **_Beruang Madu**_ (Sun Bear) in June 1987. The animatronic figures of Tenderheart Bear and Funshine Bear used in Dunia's show were initially displayed at IAAPA sometime around 1986. Although the English soundtrack was recorded first, Dunia requested Sally to send some (but not all) of the music tracks to produce a localized dub. This dub would be arranged without any involvement from Sally (aside from the instrumentation of songs). Local actors were recruited to provide the voices of the characters. A new storyline was said to have been written, eliminating the presence of both No-Heart and Beastly, as well as mentions of any other _Care Bears_ characters (Hugs and Tugs). Also unlike the English version, this dub was said to have been one full track (approximately 20 minutes in length), instead of 4-5 minute long segments. As of now, the only resources that are publicly available confirming this installation's existence are snippets of the dubbed soundtrack uploaded by Theme Park Journey; newspaper clippings about Sally which mention this show being installed at Dunia Fantasi; and production photos that were posted on Sally's current website. Given the lack of proper documentation of this show, it is also unknown when it was decommissioned (with some sources claiming to be 1992) as well as the current whereabouts of the _Care Bears_ figures.

The second, most well-known installation of the _Care-A-Lot_ show was located at [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorney_Park_%26_Wildwater_Kingdom Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom] in Allentown, Pennsylvania. To tie-in with Dorney's integration of _Care Bears_ characters in their park, Sally was commissioned to construct an almost-identical clone of the _Care-A-Lot_ show previously built for Dunia. As a result, most aspects from the prototype were adapted for Dorney's show (all character figures were refined, and different flower props were made). Given that this set used the original English soundtrack, No-Heart and Beastly's off-stage interactions remained, as well as the brief mention of Hugs and Tugs. Dorney Park's _Care-A-Lot_ show was placed in an outdoor 'theater' structure, located just across from the park's _Care Bears_ gift shop, which itself was adjacent to several kiddie rides in that area. When Dorney Park's licensing agreement with Nelvana and American Greetings expired in 1992, the animatronics were allegedly destroyed at the request of rights-holders. Despite this, the English soundtrack would be digitally preserved by Sally around 1996 (four years after the removal of both _Care-A-Lot_ shows), and would be officially released to the public on June 22, 2022.

## Characters ##

### Tenderheart Bear ###
As the de-facto leader of the Care Bears, Tenderheart is a reddish-brown bear who aspires to bring love and care to children beyond the realm of Care-A-Lot (as indicated by a heart-shaped symbol on his 'belly badge'). In this interpretation of the character, Tenderheart is portrayed as the voice of reason in a given situation. Whether it be teaching the importance of having fun and remaining as friends no matter your affiliation, or to recognize the feelings of other people, Tenderheart knows that sharing and caring are the best things in the world.

### Hugs & Tugs ###
Hugs and Tugs are baby bear twins, under the care of their beloved Grams, that are aspiring to become true _Care Bears_ like the older members. They do not actually appear in this show (neither in animatronic form, nor through disembodied voices), as they are only mentioned in passing by Friend Bear in the 'Grumps' segment of the English version.
