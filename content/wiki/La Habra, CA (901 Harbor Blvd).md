## History ##
La Habra opened sometime in May 1980 with a Cyberamics Portrait / Shelf Stage (Portrait Stage), and was the 10th PTT to open. Unfortunately, information on La Habra is scarce, and basically no info on La Habra can be found anywhere.

The location would close in 1984 (month and day unknown) for unknown reasons, but likely because it was underperforming. After closure, the location was likely split up into multiple businesses. The businesses are still operation on the former La Habra PTT.
