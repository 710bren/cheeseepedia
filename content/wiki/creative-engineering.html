<b><i>Creative Engineering Inc.</b></i> is an animatronics oriented entertainment and manufacturing company founded by <b><i>Aaron Fechter</b></i> in 1975 and stopped its major business ventures and employment in the early 2000's. It now continues to run solely by its creator as a {{< wiki-link "Creative Engineering Premium Video Service" >}}, animatronics / parts reseller, and (formerly) a fandom tourist destination, with most of these current operations inactive as they begin plans to open a {{< wiki-link "Creative Engineering Workshop" >}} and {{< wiki-link "Creative Engineering Museum" >}}.
The company is most well known for its creation of the {{< wiki-link "Rock-afire Explosion" >}} for {{< wiki-link "ShowBiz Pizza Place" >}}, which has become its frontrunning IP to present day.
