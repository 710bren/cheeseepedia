**_6303 Richmond Hwy wa**_s a _Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre_ that opened in September 20, 1982 with a Balcony Stage and closed in 2009 (day and month unknown) with a 2-Stage.

It was originally located next to a Kmart (1973-1990's?-2000's?).
## Stages## 
Originally, this location opened with the Balcony Stage. Sadly, there are no photos or videos to exist of Alexandria back then. They received Chuck E.'s House Facade in the Late 80's and the 2-Stage in the Early 90's before closing at an unknown point in 2009.

## History## 
Alexandria opened on September 20th, 1982 with the Balcony Stage. Alexandria then received the 1988 remodel in the Late 80's which removed the Balcony Stage for Chuck E.'s House Facade and removed all PTT decor and an exterior change. In the Early 90's, Alexandria received another remodel which involved another exterior change, the addition of newer decor, and the removal of Chuck E.'s House Facade for the 2-Stage. At an unknown point in 1997, the location was sold and bought to the corporate. At this point, the Kmart closed for good. In the Late 90's, Alexandria received the Phase 3 remodel which removed all older 90's decor, added newer decor, received another exterior change, and the addition of SkyTubes. Alexandria remained like this until their closure in 2009. They closed because it was in an abandoned Kmart which got redeveloped into a Walmart in 2010. After the Kmart was redeveloped into a Walmart, the Chuck E. Cheese reopened on November 20th, 2010 this time on [[Alexandria, VA (6301 Richmond Hwy)]]. Currently, as of February 2023, the former Chuck E. Cheese is now part of a Walmart and the new Chuck E. Cheese moved one space to the left.
