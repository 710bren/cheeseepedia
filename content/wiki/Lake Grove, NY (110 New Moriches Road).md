**_Sports Plus**_ was a family entertainment center that opened around August or September of 1996 with a Circus/ Fair-themed New Rock-afire Explosion Adventure Stage, and closed on June 30th, 2007. 

## History ##
Sports Plus was located in Lake Grove, NY on New Moriches Rd across from the South Haven Mall. The center was owned by Lake Grove Entertainment LLC, and had two other locations in Cincinnati, OH and Delaware. This complex included a wide variety of fun attractions on 16 acres, like bowling, ice skating, rock climbing, laser tag, paint ball, an event center, arcade games, and food. There was also an area called **'Kids Town**' for smaller children that housed the Fairgrounds-themed New Rock-afire Explosion Adventure stage. This was the only NRAE adventure stage to be sold, and the only fairground-themed adventure stage to be built. The show feature the three 'main' characters, Billy Bob, Fatz, and Mitzi, along with Looney Bird and TV's on each side of the stage. It ran on a show-selector system as all New Rock-afire Explosion shows did, and did not feature karaoke. The center closed in June 2007 and auctioned off all of their assets. Since its closure, the Sports Plus property has been split up between multiple businesses. 

### Thriller Coaster ###

In June of 2004, Kids Town was replaced with a new indoor roller coaster ride, and The New Rock-afire Explosion show was uninstalled. The fate of the characters resided in the ride as static props along with several other, miscellaneous Halloween props.
