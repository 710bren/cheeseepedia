<p><h2>History</h2></p>

In 1991, Torrance (Pacific Coast) received Concept Unification and also fully received the 1988 remodel which removed the Rock-Afire for the 3-Stage, Neon Signage, Blue and White Awnings, & some checkers around the store, and the change and renaming of the exterior. The text on the exterior was taken from a Pizza Time Theatre that closed. Torrance (Pacific Coast) underwent another remodel in the Mid 1990's which involved the removal of CU decor for the Record Posters, & some checkers around the store, and the removal of the ball pit for SkyTubes. The exterior remained the same. In the Late 90's, Torrance (Pacific Coast) received the Phase 2 remodel which involved removing 1990's store art including the record posters, a logo and text change to the exterior, some 1990's elements, and added Toddler Zone. The 3-Stage was then removed for the Studio C Alpha in 2000. When the 1995 logo was installed, the 1988 remodel logo is gone but the label scar of the logo (1988 Remodel) was still there. In January 2010, Torrance (Pacific Coast) received the 2005 update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative which removing all 1990's store art, Balcony Seating, Showroom Walls, adding purple walls.
