<p>The <b>Bird Animatronic</b> is an animatronic figure created by Garner Holt Productions Inc. for Chuck E. Cheese's locations from 1997 to 2002</p>
<p>The bot is a mostly green parrot with wings that are red, orange, and yellow sitting on a perch. He was only installed on the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Studio C Alpha" >}}">Studio C Alpha</a> and Studio C Prototype stage.</p>
<p><h2> History </h2></p>
<p>The <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Studio C" >}}">Studio C</a> concept originally debuted in December of 1997 as a brand-new show idea intended originally to replace all Munch's Make Believe Band stages which featured one Chuck E. animatronic, and a little parrot named Bird. This setup was called the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Studio C Alpha" >}}">Studio C Alpha</a>, and featured Chuck E. and Bird in a late night talk show studio, complete with a light-up desk, a 'Pizza Time' clock, a pizza phone, an <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Interactive Console" >}}">Interactive Console</a>, and a Blue Screen with a camera. The bird was later included in the Studio C Prototype stage. This stage featured Bird on a taller perch than what was on the Studio C Alpha. This stage would be the last to feature Bird though, as future iterations of Studio C would not feature him.</p>
<p><h2> Movements </h2></p>
<p>The bot features 4 movements in total.</p>
