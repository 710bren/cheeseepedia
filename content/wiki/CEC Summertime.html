For stores still using reels, an accompanying music cassette was provided that included radio songs. These would be played between segments on the reel to make up for the lack of intermissions.

The showtape used [Showbiz Pizza Program 11]({{< ref "wiki/Showbiz Pizza Program 11.html" >}}), which was also given alongside the [SPP May 1988 Show]({{< ref "wiki/SPP May 1988 Show.html" >}}) tape released at the same time.
