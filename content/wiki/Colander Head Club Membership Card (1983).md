The **_Colander Head Club Membership Card**_ was a special card produced for contributing patrons of the [\2](\1) during the month of March 1983.

The card could be used to win prizes on Wednesday nights during the event if also wearing a colander to the restaurant.

##  Obtainability ## 
The card was obtainable by fulfilling multiple criteria from March 1st - 31st of 1983.<ref>[\2](\1)</ref>

# Attend a ShowBiz Pizza Place wearing a colander on your head, encouraged to be customized and decorated but not required.
# Request the staff to play the [\2](\1) in the Showroom, or wait till Wednesday nights where the show would be played for the groups attending.
# Watch the skit and follow along with its instructions by taking the oath (though following along was not enforced).

A ShowBiz employee would then hand you the card. Patrons could then return each Wednesday night to receive 6 free tokens, a free coke, and a signed picture of one of the Rock-afire Explosion characters. Despite Colander Night returning in September of 1983 for the [\2](\1), the membership card would not be handed out- nor used to identify members for prizes.<ref>[[Crazy Colander Head Night (Event)]]</ref>
