## History## 
The Lounge act would first debut at the [[Huntington Beach, CA (15511 Edwards St)]]. It was a simple character. Its thought that she had the exact same movements as Jasper T. Jowls. She was installed in very few stores as The King would replace her the same year. As of now there is little to no documentation on her. We only have her showtape and three photos of her. 

## Movements## 
The bot features 8 movements in total.
