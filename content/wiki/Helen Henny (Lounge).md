The **_Lounge**_ **_Helen Henny [Cyberamics]({{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics.md" >}})**_ were a set of around 2 animatronic figures created by [Pizza Time Theatre]({{< ref "wiki/Pizza Time Theatre.md" >}}) from 1979 to 1980 for Lounge acts. They were designed after the PTT guest star, [Helen Henny]({{< ref "wiki/Helen Henny.md" >}}).

There are very little known to be produced as she was immediately replaced by The King / King Kat (Lounge) (The King), though later Helen Henny cosmetics were created for the Guest Star / Helen Henny (Cyberamic) (Guest Star Cyberamics), which became the only ones after the merger.
##History##
The bot would first debut at the [Huntington Beach, CA (15511 Edwards St)]({{< ref "wiki/Huntington Beach, CA (15511 Edwards St).md" >}}) in Late 1979 with the Cabaret Helen Showtape. The bot was stationed at Huntington's former lounge area. Only a few more bots were created, one being installed at [Citrus Heights, CA (7614 Greenback Lane)]({{< ref "wiki/Citrus Heights, CA (7614 Greenback Lane).md" >}}) in early 1980. The bot was quickly replaced by The King / King Kat (Lounge) (The King Lounge act), with the last Helen being removed during Huntington Beachâ€™s 1988 Remodel. 

##Movements##
