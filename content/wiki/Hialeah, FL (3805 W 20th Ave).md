**_8515 W 20th Ave i**_s a Chuck E. Cheese that opened in April 2, 1991 as a corporate location with a Road Stage which is still open to this day.

It is located in the Westland Promenade Shopping Mall. It should not be confused with the [[Hialeah, FL (500 W 49th St)]] location as it opened as a franchised location on December 20th, 1982 and was bought by corporate on October 22nd, 1984 along with 50 other locations and closed in 1985 or 1986 with a Balcony Stage.
## History## 
Hialeah opened on April 2nd, 1991 as a corporate-owned location. Hialeah opened with the 1988 Remodel including the CU decor, and the Road Stage. Around the mid-late 1990s, Hialeah replaced their logo with Coach Chuck and removed older 90's decor for newer decor and the removal of the ball pit for SkyTubes. In 2007 or 2008, Hialeah remodeled to the 2005 remodel which involved the removal of the showroom walls, removing older decor for newer decor, new booths, relocating the stage, & adding purple walls. Hialeah remained like this until December 2021 when they received the 2.0 remodel and removed the Road Stage for the Dance Floor. Currently, as of February 2023, the location still has the 2.0 Remodel and the Dance Floor.
## Stages## 
Like all Road Stages at the time, Chuck wore his Tuxedo & Derby outfit. Up and Down curtains were added by the Late 90's. In the Early 2000's, this was replaced with the Cool Chuck outfit. By the Late 2000's, Chuck's outfit was replaced with the Avenger outfit.

The stage was removed in January 2022 for the 2.0 Remodel and Dance Floor.

As of February 2023, Hialeah still has the Dance Floor and 2.0 Remodel.
