<b><i>Jasper</b></i>, full name <b><i>Jasper Tennessee Jowls</b></i>, is one of the main characters of the Chuck E. Cheese's franchise, having made his debut at the [San Jose, CA (370 S Winchester Blvd)]({{< ref "wiki/San Jose, CA (370 S Winchester Blvd).md" >}}) location in 1977.

<h2> History </h2>

<h2>= Pizza Time Theatre </h2>=
From as early as 1977, Jasper was a country loving hound dog. He was loud and not too smart, being portrayed by Scott Paulin. He had buck teeth, wrinkles, a banjo, and a straw hat. He would often laugh at any joke, no matter how poor its content was, causing Chuck E. Cheese (Chuck) to yell at the technician to turn off the 'fruitcake dog.' He would flirt and obsess over the female guest stars, most notably Harmony Howlette.

<h2>== Post-Merger </h2>==
Starting in 1986, Jasper would be voiced by Bob West. Jasper would be portrayed as friendly and intelligent after the merger. Jasper seemed younger, and could speak in full sentences without breaking into a fit of laughter.

<h2>== Concept Unification & Chuck E. Cheese's </h2>==
During [Concept Unification]({{< ref "wiki/Concept Unification.md" >}}), Jasper as a character mostly remained the same. However, he was now playing the guitar. Jasper would mostly remain the same till 1999. He also received a new outfit. He wore blue overalls, a white shirt with cow spot pattern, a red bandanna, and a cowboy hat. Jasper started to be voiced by Jeremy Blaido starting in 1999, who now portrayed the character as snarky and sarcastic. This would continue through 2012.

<h2>== 'Rockstar' </h2>==
In 2012, Chuck E. Cheese was 'given the pink slip,' per the Associated Press. Due to declining revenue, CEC Entertainment sought to give Chuck E. a makeover, shrinking him down into a guitar-playing life-size mouse. Initially, Chuck's friends remained the same until 2014. Jasper was given a redesign. He now had light brown fur, a blue shirt, a red collar, jeans, and cowboy boots. Jasper would play the bass guitar, as Chuck had taken the role of lead guitarist. Jaspers personality would begin to change. He became wholesome, rarely showing his former comedic self unless the script called for it.
