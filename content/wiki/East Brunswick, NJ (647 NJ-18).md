647 NJ-18 was a Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre that opened on March 5, 1984 and closed in 1986 (month and day unknown) with a Balcony Stage. Not counting modern locations, this was the second-to-last PTT in New Jersey. 

Unfortunately, information on the East Brunswick store is extremely scarce, but we do have a photo of their exterior in 1984, shortly after opening.

## History ##
East Brunswick's Chuck E. Cheese opened on March 5, 1984 with a Balcony Stage. Unfortunately, not much info is known about this location, other than one exterior photo, but no videos exist at the moment. In 1986 (month and day unknown), the location shut its doors forever for unknown reasons, but likely due to underperforming, a reason for many other stores closing at the time. According to Google's Street View, the space of the location is now part of a Stop & Shop store.
