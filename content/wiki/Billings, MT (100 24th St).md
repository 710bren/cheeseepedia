**_100 24th St W**_ was a _Chuck E. Cheese’s_ that opened on August 6, 1984 as a franchised _ShowBiz Pizza Place_ with a Rock afire Explosion.
##History##
Fargo opened its doors in August 6th, 1984 with a Rock-afire Explosion show. It was originally a franchise-owned store. Like many other ShowBiz locations, it had a typical SPP layout seen in many other stores across the United States and would eventually receive the 1988 remodel years after it would open. Although very little documentation exists back in the ShowBiz days, it can be determined that Fargo was one of several locations to receive an Uncle Klunk show package (and a Santa Claus retrofit package as well) sometime after opening. Like many ShowBiz locations in the late 1980s, Fargo received the Showbiz Pizza Campground upgrade.

In around 1991/1992, Fargo received Concept Unification which converted the show to Munch's Make Believe Band. In around the Mid-Late 1900's, Fargo received either [Phase 1]({{< ref "wiki/Phase 1 (1994).md" >}}) or [Phase 2]({{< ref "wiki/Phase 2 (1997).md" >}}) remodel. Fargo remained this way until sometime in 2009 when they received a major 2005 Remodel which involved removing the Showroom Walls, balcony Seating, and redoing the entire left hand side of the store, only leaving the Pickup Window. Them among with [Fargo, ND]({{< ref "wiki/Fargo, ND (1202 Nodak Dr).md" >}}) were one of the first locations to switch to Pepsi in the 2000s. Both stores were bought out by Corporate in October 2022. <ref>https://www.inforum.com/business/chuck-e-cheese-to-reopen-soon-in-south-fargo</ref>. 
##Stages##
Fargo opened with the Rock afire Explosion in 1984. Unfortunately, there are hardly any photos or videos to exist of Fargo with the Rock afire, or as a ShowBiz in general. But, there is a photo of its original exterior. 

In the 1990s, Fargo received [Concept Unification]({{< ref "wiki/Concept Unification.md" >}}), converting the Rock afire into Munch’s Make Believe Band.

In December 2022, Fargo started the 2.0 Remodel, removing the 3-Stage and adding a Dance Floor + Video Wall.
