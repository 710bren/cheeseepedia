<p>Tallahassee opened on August 9, 1982, with a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage" >}}">Balcony Stage</a>. Nothing is known about Tallahassee's Pizza Time Theatre, however. The location would close on November 18, 1984, due to underperformance.</p>
<p><h3>Post Pizza Time Theatre</h3></p>
<p>The location would sit vacant for a period of time before becoming part of a Walgreen's. The Walgreen's would close between 2008 and 2010 and become Dollar Tree. As of August 2023, Dollar Tree sits on the space.</p>
