This store's stage was <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Studio C Beta" >}}">Studio C Beta, 16m</a>, which wore the Avenger outfit. Springfield, OR opened with <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Skytubes" >}}">Skytubes</a> and has had them for its entire existence.

On September 14, 2014, the store would be permanently closed. It was likely due to the mall's renovation plans that was scheduled to take place that following year. It is unknown what happened to the animatronics at this location, although it was most likely taken back to the SPT distribution center.

After the store permanently closed, the location along with several other buildings would be completely demolished for the mall renovation. Today, a Rack Room Shoes as well as a relocated Oregon Sports sits in the site of the former space.
