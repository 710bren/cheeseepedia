**_3-Stage Sixteen Tons**_ was a segment programmed at CEC Corporate by _Brian Hagan_ for fun.

The segment's audio was ripped from the original _Showbiz Pizza Place_ [Country Night]({{< ref "wiki/Country Night.md" >}}) reel that CEC Corporate owned, and programmed by Brian on the 3-Stage using [APS]({{< ref "wiki/Animation Programming System.md" >}}). Due to the segment not ever being produced for stores, the only format it was left on was the Format: APS (APS format), in the form of a floppy disk.

Corporate would later destroy the original Showbiz reels in 2000, with _Matt Daniel_ ripping the audio off them beforehand.<ref></ref>

## Creation ##
Attention was brought to the creation of this segment in the _Brian Hagan Interview_ conducted in late 2021. At 5:00:57, he mentions:<ref>https://youtu.be/5mqJMsr_PLU?t=18056</ref><blockquote>**One of the first things I did for giggles when I joined the Entertainment Department was put in an old EPROM into the Cyberstar system and grabbed one of the Showbiz tapes and popped it in and watched the 3-Stage perform Rock-afire Explosion numbers, with Chuck E. being Rolfe, Munch being Fatz, Helen being Mitzi, Pasqually being Dook, and no Billy Bob. It was kind of funny to watch some of that play back, and then the first thing I ever programmed in that studio- reprogrammed from scratch to the audio, I time striped one of the original recordings they had, and programmed the 3-Stage to the original 'Sixteen Tons' that Fatz did with the Rock-afire Explosion. No footage of that, but I did it.** - Brian Hagan</blockquote>In a later email<ref></ref>, Brian would mention the showtape's creation to be around September to October of 1996, along with any other possible employee to have ever programmed a show for fun being _Brent Gray._
