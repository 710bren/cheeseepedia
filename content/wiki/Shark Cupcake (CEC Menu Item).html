The <b><i>Shark Cupcake</b></i> was a limited time dessert item at Chuck E. Cheese locations as part of the <i>Summer of Fun 2022</i> seasonal event.<ref>https://comicbook.com/irl/news/chuck-e-cheese-debuts-the-shark-cupcake-in-time-for-shark-week-summer-of-fun/</ref>

The item is a single vanilla cupcake, topped with grey icing and two white sugar wafers for eyes. A plastic shark fin inserted on the top and a custom cupcake liner designed to look like shark teeth covers the bottom.<ref><nowiki>https://www.chuckecheese.com/blogs/food/shark-cupcake/</nowiki></ref>
