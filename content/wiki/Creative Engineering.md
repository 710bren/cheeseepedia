**_Creative Engineering Inc.**_ is an animatronics oriented entertainment and manufacturing company founded by **_Aaron Fechter**_ in 1975 and stopped its major business ventures and employment in the early 2000's. It now continues to run solely by its creator as a [paid video platform]({{< ref "wiki/Creative Engineering Premium Video Service.md" >}}), animatronics / parts reseller, and (formerly) a fandom tourist destination, with most of these current operations inactive as they begin plans to open a [parts warehouse]({{< ref "wiki/Creative Engineering Workshop.md" >}}) and [museum]({{< ref "wiki/Creative Engineering Museum.md" >}}).
