[]] **Gillian's Wonderland Pier** is a historic amusement park founded in 1929 by David Gillian, who first came to Ocean City in 1914.  It is located near the beginning of the commercial boardwalk on 6th street. Gillians is generally considered to be an institution of Ocean City, with grand openings and pre-season sales for the location historically having drawn crowds multiple blocks long, and employs many local youths during the summer, and in more recent years, many Eastern European workers.-wikipedia

Gillian started his career in the orchestra at C. Elwood Carpenter's Dance Club (aka The Casino), located over the Moorlyn Theater on the old Boardwalk.  In 1917 he transferred to the Hippodrome pier, where he played with Robin Robinson's Orchestra. The Hippodrome had a movie theatre, vaudeville, dancing and amusements for children.

In October 1927, a fire destroyed the Hippodrome, after which the burned boardwalk was replaced in 1928. In 1930, David Gillian opened a Fun Deck at Plymouth Place and the Boardwalk. The two main attractions were a Ferris wheel and a carousel. The Fun Deck was transformed into a water park (today known as OC Waterpark) after 1987.

In honor of his 100th birthday in 1990, David Gillian donated a horse from the Carousel to the Ocean City Historical Museum.  David Gillian died in March 1993 at the age of 102.

In 1957, David Gillian retired and his sons, Bob and Roy took over from 1957-1977. In 1965, Roy left the family business and started Wonderland Pier at 6th Street and the Boardwalk (where Stainton's Playland had burned down 10 years prior), with 10 rides and a parking lot.

Roy became mayor of Ocean City in 1985, and retired from politics in 1989.  In 1994, Roy became the president of IAAPA (International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions). His son, Jay Gillian, became mayor of Ocean City in 2010.

The Gillian family decided to expand their business beyond Ocean City by opening Gillian's Funland of Sea Isle City, located on JFK Boulevard. In January 2021 Gillian's was under foreclosure but the Gillian family announced they would still be open for the 2021 season. On March 30 they announced they were teaming up with Icona Hotel owners to enhance the park.

Gillian's Wonderland Pier is famous for its 144-foot (44 m) Giant Wheel, one of the largest Ferris wheels on the east coast.-wikipedia
