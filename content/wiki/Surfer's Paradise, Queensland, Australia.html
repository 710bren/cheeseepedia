<b><i>2 Cavill Avenue</b></i> was a [Charlie Cheese's Pizza Playhouse]({{< ref "wiki/Charlie Cheese's Pizza Playhouse.md" >}}) that opened in March 1981 with a Portrait Stage & closed in 1982. This location is not to be confused with [Carina, Queensland (1151 Creek Rd)]({{< ref "wiki/Carina, Queensland, Australia.md" >}}) which opened after the closure of Cavill or [???, Australia]({{< ref "wiki/, Australia.md" >}}) which is set to open in spring or summer of 2024.

This was the very first location outside of the United States, and the first of almost 3 Chuck E. Cheese stores in Australia.

<h2> Stage </h2>
Cavill opened with one of the last [Cyberamics Portrait / Shelf Stage]({{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Portrait  Shelf Stage.md" >}}) with the Stage having balcony elements, decor, & a Cheese Crawl. Cavill also opened with Dolli DImples as their one & only Cabaret act.

<h2> History </h2>
In 1981, After PTT went public, plans were made to develop international locations, a location was set to open in Australia.  The location was in a entertainment venue called 'Grundy's Paradise Centre' in Surfer's Paradise, Queensland. The location had a Balcony styled Shelf Stage, Dolli Dimples as the Cabaret act, and Madame Oink as the guest star. The Showtape used was probably either [Around the World with Madam Oink]({{< ref "wiki/Around the World with Madam Oink.md" >}}) or Madame Oink III - 'Tunnel of Love'. The location would be featured on an Australian News Broadcast in 1981 & another the same year. The Location closed in 1982 & was relocated to [Creek Road in Carina, Queensland]({{< ref "wiki/Carina, Queensland, Australia.md" >}}).
