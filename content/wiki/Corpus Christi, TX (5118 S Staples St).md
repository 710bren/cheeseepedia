##History##
Corpus Christi opened its doors on April 1983 with a Balcony Stage show. It was originally a franchised-owned store. Like many other Pizza Time Theatre locations, it had a typical PTT layout seen in many other stores across the United States and would eventually receive the 1988 remodel years after it would open which involved the blue and white awnings, and the colorful checkers.

In the late 80's , Corpus Christi removed the Balcony Stage for the C-Stage and added the late 80's and early 90's decor. Around the Mid 1990's, Corpus Christi received either [https://chuckepedia.com/wiki/Phase_1_(1994) Phase 1] or [https://chuckepedia.com/wiki/Phase_2_(1997) Phase 2] remodel which removed some early 90's and late 80's decor and added SkyTubes,. This remodel also removed the C-Stage for the 2-Stage. Corpus Christi remained this way until October 2003 when they received the Prototype 2005 Remodel which involved removing the Showroom Walls, balcony Seating, received a new exterior, removing all of the older 80's and 90's decor, and received the prototype decor. They also removed the 2-Stage and got the Studio C Beta stage. In 2012, they received the full 2005 remodel which removed the prototype decor for the newer ones.
