<h2> History </h2>
Victorville opened on December 14, 1999, with the [Phase 2]({{< ref "wiki/Phase 2 (1997).md" >}}) remodel and a Studio C (1997) (Studio C Alpha). A few years later between 2000 and 2002, they received [Phase 3]({{< ref "wiki/Phase 3 (2000).md" >}}). Around 2007, they received the 2005 update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative, which involved removing all 90s decor, removing showroom walls and balcony seating, expanded the store, added purple walls, and changed the exterior. The [Skytubes]({{< ref "wiki/Skytubes.md" >}}) were removed sometime in the mid-late 2010s. In April 2022, Victorville received the 2.0 remodel, removing the Studio C Alpha for a 2021 Model Chuck E. Live Stage (Dance Floor) (Dance Floor) and [Video Wall]({{< ref "wiki/Video Wall.md" >}}). The grand reopening occurred on June 2, 2022. As of August 2023, Victorville remains operational with the 2.0 remodel.
