<b><i>Lion</b></i> (also known as <b><i>The Lion</b></i>) was a retrofit of [Jasper T. Jowls (Cyberamic)]({{< ref "wiki/Jasper T Jowls (Cyberamic).md" >}}) used at the [Fun Zone & Pizza]({{< ref "wiki/Fun Zone & Pizza.md" >}}) on [Chico, CA (966 East Ave)]({{< ref "wiki/Chico, CA (966 East Ave).md" >}}). The bot was retrofitted after the location lost its license to the CEC IP. 

<h2> History </h2>

<h2>= As Jasper T. Jowls </h2>=
The bot was originally produced somewhere from 1981 to 1982 & was placed at the Pizza Time Theatre on [Chico, CA (966 East Ave)]({{< ref "wiki/Chico, CA (966 East Ave).md" >}}) in July 1982. The bot had standard PTT attire. In 1993, The bot would gain new CEC styled cosmetics when Chico got their [2-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/2-Stage.md" >}}).

In January 2011, The Chuck E. Cheese's in [Chico, CA]({{< ref "wiki/Chico, CA (966 East Ave).md" >}}) lost its license to run as a CEC, forcing them to change their branding to Fun Zone & Pizza. They converted their Munch's Make Believe Band characters into generic animals, The Lion uses a generic [https://www.halloweencostumes.com/mascot-lion-costume.html mascot costume] instead of the Jasper Cyberamic ones, though they still had the Cyberamics Cheese Guitar. The bot used Chuck E's lower half. The bot's head had a tin can either over it or replacing its former one.

When Fun Zone & Pizza closed in September 2011, the characters were stripped from their cosmetics and removed and sold in a group for $100. It is unknown if anybody purchased them or where they are today.
