The Lion was a retrofit of Jasper T. Jowls that was located at Fun Zone & Pizza in Chico, CA 966 East Ave 95926. 

In January 2011, The Chuck E. Cheese's in Chico, CA lost its license to run as a CEC, forcing them to change their branding to Fun Zone & Pizza. They converted their Munch's Make Believe Band characters into generic animals, The Lion uses a generic [https://www.halloweencostumes.com/mascot-lion-costume.html mascot costume], Jasper's top half, and Chucks bottom half.  

When Fun Zone & Pizza closed in September 2011, the cosmetics from the characters were removed and sold in a group for $100. It is unknown if anybody purchased them or where they are today. 

##  Mechanics ## 
The mechanism was the same as a cyberamic, the only difference is that the head mechanism was replaced by a tin can. No showtapes were produced, and DirectTV was played on the television screens in the showroom.
