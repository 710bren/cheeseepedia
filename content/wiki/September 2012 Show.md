<h2> Trivia: </h2>

* This was the first showtape to feature [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaret_Reddick Jaret Reddick] as the voice of Chuck E. Cheese. 
* All the live shows for Fall 2012 still use Duncan's voice. 
* Duncan Brannan originally recorded this show. However his original recordings for this show are currently unavailable to the public, allegedly due to them being accidentally deleted from Dept. 18's archives.
* A character named 'Chaze' is introduced in this show. He is described as taking common phrases too literally. He is never seen or mentioned prior to or after this show.
* This show mentions lots of references to Duncans early show work for CEC such as having Segment 4 have the band reading through a script of September 1994 Segment 1 Dialogue. As the show is ending they make more jokes about various other show lines of the past with Pasqually saying 'Remember Destination Imagination' and Jasper responds 'Now that is a joke'. 
* This is the final show to use the Band Stage set up for the puppets. This would also be the last time new footage was shot with all of them (Jasper's would appear for the Super Jasper intermission in January 2013) as the next time all the puppets were used with April 2013 they received new puppets to match the rockstar design.
