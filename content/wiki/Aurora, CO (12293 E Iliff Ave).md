[[File:Chuck-e-cheese.jpg|thumb|Aurora, CO's exterior after the 1993 shooting. Dates December 14, 1993.]]
**_12293 E Iliff Ave**_ was a Showbiz Pizza Place/Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza which opened on January 28, 1981 as a Showbiz Pizza Place with a Rock-afire Explosion, and closed on April 20, 1994 as a Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza with a 3-Stage. This location is very well known because of a shooting that took place on December 14, 1993. 

This location is not to be confused with [the current location]({{< ref "wiki/Aurora, CO (14005 E Exposition Ave).md" >}}), which opened on November 2, 1999 with a Studio C Alpha, and is still open with the 2.0 remodel.

## History ##

### As a Showbiz Pizza (January 28, 1981 - 1991 or 1992) ###
The location opened on January 28, 1981 with a Rock-afire Explosion stage. Unfortunately, information on Aurora as a Showbiz is scarce. It is unknown if they ever received the 1988 remodel.

### Pre-shooting Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza (1991 or 1992 - December 14, 1993) ###
Between 1991 and 1992, Concept Unification was in full swing, and Aurora fell victim. This involved removing all Showbiz décor for Chuck E. Cheese's décor, kept artifacts from the 1988 remodel (if they ever got it), and changing the Rock-afire Explosion into the 3-Stage. The store remained functioning normally until the night of December 14, 1993.

### Shooting Sequence (December 14, 1993) ###
A guy named Nathan Dunlap, who was dismissed from his job from the store in July 1993, entered the store at around 9:00 PM. He decided to order a ham and cheese sandwich and played a random arcade game. He then hid in one of the bathrooms until around 9:50. The store would then close for the night at 10:00 PM. 5 minutes later, he exited the bathroom to begin his murder spree. The first victim was Sylvia Crowell, who was cleaning up the salad bar. Nathan shot her in the right ear, and was mortally wounded. Next, he found Ben Grant, who was vacuuming the floor. He shot him near his right eye, also mortally wounding him. He then found Colleen O'Connor, who pleaded for her life, but was shot in the forehead. The second-to-last victim was Bobby Stephens, who was the only survivor. He was shot in the jaw, and then played dead. The final victim was Marge Kohlberg, who was forced by Nathan to open the safe. She was shot in both ears. The police eventually tracked down Nathan, and he was arrested. This event possibly caused the store to lose its popularity.

### Post Closure (April 20, 1994 - today) ###
The store began to massively decline after the incident. The store finally locked its doors on April 20, 1994 for unknown reasons, but likely due to the shooting that happened a year prior, causing the store to lose guests. The building fall into Panera Bread's hands in the 2000s. As of June 2023, Panera Bread still occupies the space.

## Stages ##
The store at first contained a Rock-afire Explosion show. We can confirm they had the Beta bots. It is unknown if they received the Showbiz Pizza Campground upgrade in the late '80s. It was changed into a 3-Stage between 1991 and 1992 due to Concept Unification. The 3-Stage remained until the April 1994 closure. The history of their bots is completely unknown.
