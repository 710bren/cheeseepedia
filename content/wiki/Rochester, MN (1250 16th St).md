##  History ## 
Rochester opened on December 14, 2010 with a [\2](\1) and the 2010 update to the [[2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative]]. This location was notable for keeping the Skytubes up until 2020. However, there isn't much documentation from Rochester other than videos from the YouTuber, 'Cheese E. Chuck'. The location would permanently close in June 2020 (day unknown) due to COVID-19 and the company was also about to go bankrupt. As of August 2023, the building remains vacant, with the avenger logo shape and the awnings still intact.
