## History ##
Rochester opened on December 14th 2010 with a Studio C 2000 (Studio C Beta, 16m) and the 2010 update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative. This location was notable for keeping the Skytubes up until 2020. However, there isn't much documentation from Rochester other than videos from the YouTuber, 'Cheese E. Chuck'. The location would permanently close on June 24th 2020. Due to COVID-19 and the company was also about to go bankrupt. As of August 2023, the building remains vacant, with the avenger logo shape and the awnings still intact.
