{{Animatronic|releasedate=1978|manufacturer=Creative Engineering|image=wp5_man.png}}The Wolfman was created for the Wolf Pack 5 show and debuted at the 1978 IAAPA. He is meant to be a parody of the radio DJ, Wolfman Jack. Wolfman's mask uses the same mold as Buddy Crash from the Bear Country Jubilee, with teeth and mustache glued on.
