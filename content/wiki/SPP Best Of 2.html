<b><i>SPP Best Of 2 / Wave Bday</b></i> is one of the last few showtapes released for <i>Showbiz Pizza Place's</i> hosting the <i>Rock-afire Explosion</i>.

For some stores, this was the last tape used before <i>Concept Unification</i> would start at their location. Each tape sent after [SPP Christmas '89 / Wave Bday]({{< ref "wiki/SPP Christmas '89  Wave Bday.md" >}}) would become increasingly more rare as stores would convert to <i>3-Stages.</i>

Despite the later years of <i>Cyberstar</i> being mostly re-used segments from earlier showtapes, the last showtapes became the 'Best of' series, bringing back every single <i>Cyberstar</i> segment for stores to have. It was said at this time that due to the <i>Rock-afire Explosion</i> being phased out, stores could play whatever showtapes they had without sticking to the most recent show. The <i>Best of</i> series could be seen as an encouragement of this.

<h2> Trivia: </h2>

* Just like it counterpart [CEC Jan '91]({{< ref "wiki/CEC Jan '91.md" >}}) this is the last show to feature any video intermissions moving forward, It's Showtime! bumper which was introduced back in 1988 retires. While CEC dropped the Cyberstar Intro in their next show [CEC Future]({{< ref "wiki/CEC Future.md" >}}) in favor for their new CEC-TV animated intro, Showbiz Pizza continues to use the Cyberstar Intro in their next show [SPP Best Of 3 / Wave Bday]({{< ref "wiki/SPP Best Of 3  Wave Bday.md" >}}).
