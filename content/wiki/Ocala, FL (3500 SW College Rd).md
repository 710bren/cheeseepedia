**3500 SW College Rd** was a _Chuck E. Cheese's_ that opened in April 26, 2005 as a corporate location with a [Studio C Cappa]({{< ref "wiki/Studio C Cappa.md" >}}) and is still open to this day.

## History ##

Ocala opened on April 26, 2005 as a corporate-owned location, when they received the 2005 update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative which involved the removal of the showroom walls, removing older decor for newer decor, & adding purple walls.They were the first location to open up with the 2005 Remodel. In around the Mid-Late 2010's, the purple and red awnings were removed from the building, a day after [Tampa, FL (14308 Dale Mabry Hwy)]({{< ref "wiki/Tampa, FL (14308 Dale Mabry Hwy).md" >}}) removed theirs a day earlier in 2019. The store's Grand Reopening took place on December 2021; just a day after which was on CEC's 46th Anniversary.

Originally, when the store opened, the location had a Studio C Cappa stage like every other store opening at the time until it was removed on November 2021 for a 2021 Model Dance Floor & Video Wall.
