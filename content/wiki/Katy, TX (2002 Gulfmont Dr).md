##### _Katy, TX(2002 Gulfmont Dr)_ is a Chuck E. Cheese’s that opened on December of 2001 and is still open today with the 2.0 remodel. #####

## Stages ##
When this location opened, it had a prototype studio c beta that had one TV. It would stay like this until 2020 when it would be replaced by the 2019 model dance floor. It would later be upgraded in 2021 due to corporate’s funding of the Houston locations.

## History ##
Katy opened in 2001/2002 near the growing Katy Mills mall as a phase 3. In the late 2000s- the early 2010s, Katy would receive the 2005 Cool Chuck reconfiguration which involved removing showroom walls, replacing older decor for newer decor, and painting specific walls purple. Despite this, the phase 3 exterior remained intact. It would remain like this until march of 2020 right before the pandemic when this location would receive 2.0 which involved replacing older decor with newer decor, getting rid of the studio c beta, and upgrading the atmosphere to a more modern look. In 2023, Katy would receive the new trampoline zone concept. As of 2024, Katy remains like this.
