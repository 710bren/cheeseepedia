<b><i>Pasqually the Chef</b></i>, full name <b><i>Pasqually Pizza Pieplate</b></i>, is one of the main characters of the Chuck E. Cheese's franchise, having made his debut at the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/San Jose, CA (370 S Winchester Blvd)" >}}">San Jose, CA (370 S Winchester Blvd)</a> location in 1977. 

<h2> History </h2>

<h2>= Pizza Time Theatre </h2>=
From as early as 1977, Pasqually was <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Chuck E Cheese" >}}">Chuck E. Cheese</a>'s chef. Originally portrayed by Joe Spano, the early shows would portray Pasqually as a stereotypical yet rough around the edges Italian chef with a snobby personality. Pasqually's original design had a chef hat as well as a long sleeved shirt with a red and white plaid design. He wore a red bandanna and a white apron. He had black curly hair and a big mustache. This design would be used for decades to come. In the first two locations Pasqually held a pizza as well as a pizza cutter and was intended to announce pizza orders, but the concept never came to be. When the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage" >}}">Balcony Stage</a> got introduced, Pasqually now played the accordion. Joe Spano was later replaced by Scott Wilson in 1983.

<h2>= ShowBiz Pizza Time </h2>=

<h2>== Post-Merger </h2>==
Pasquallys's character was changed as the newly merged ShowBiz Pizza Time was looking for its identity. He would now be voiced by Bob West, and had a much friendlier personality than before.

<h2>== Concept Unification & Mid-1990's </h2>==
During <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Concept Unification" >}}">Concept Unification</a>, Pasqually as a character mostly remained the same. However, he was now playing the drums. The mid-1990's was a transitional phase for Chuck E. and the company itself, as it distanced itself from the ShowBiz name. Bob West was replaced by Joel McCrary from 1994 to 1996. Pasqually would have his own segments within the showtapes, telling jokes and becoming an all around more comedic character. Duncan Brannan began to voice Pasqually around the time the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Awesome Adventure Machine" >}}">Awesome Adventure Machine</a> showtapes were created, and he continued to do so till 1999. Pasqually received a backstory around this time explaining that Chuck found Pasqually as he was selling pizza door to door. They eventually started the first Chuck E. Cheese location in a wrecked building. 

<h2>= Chuck E. Cheese's </h2>=
1997 was a pivotal time for the soon-to-be CEC Entertainment, as they were attempting to paint Chuck himself as a more hip character. This of course meant Chucks friends had to adapt to the times as well. Pasqually, while being the least changed out of the cast, still got minor tweaks. Starting in 1999, he began to be voiced by Earl Fisher. Pasqually would become a lot quicker, talking and laughing in a pace that better matched the current cast. He was still Chuck's right hand man. Art now portrayed Pasqually with much lighter skin, as well as a blue shirt.

<h2>== 'Rockstar' </h2>==
In 2012, Chuck E. Cheese was 'given the pink slip,' per the Associated Press. Due to declining revenue, CEC Entertainment sought to give Chuck E. a makeover, shrinking him down into a guitar-playing life-size mouse. Initially, Chuck's friends remained the same until 2014. Pasqually was given a redesign. He now had straight hair, beige pants, and his blue shirt. He has retained his personality since 1999, as Earl Fisher still continues to voice Pasqually to this day. In 2017 Pasqually's backstory was changed. He was a struggling restaurant owner in New York who was about to close his doors, but managed to stay in business due to Chucks singing.

<h2>== Pasqually's Pizza & Wings </h2>==
In 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, a ghost kitchen delivery service started under the name <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Pasqually's Pizza & Wings" >}}">Pasqually's Pizza & Wings</a>. This caused controversy as it sold the same food served at Chuck E. Cheese locations.
