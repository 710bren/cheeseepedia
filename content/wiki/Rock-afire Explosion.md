The **_Rock-afire Explosion**_ was an animatronic show created by [Creative Engineering]({{< ref "wiki/Creative Engineering.md" >}}) for [ShowBiz Pizza Place]({{< ref "wiki/ShowBiz Pizza Place.md" >}}) from 1980 to 1983, which would be used in its restaurants until ShowBiz started [Concept Unification]({{< ref "wiki/Concept Unification.md" >}}) from 1989 to 1992.

Most remaining Rock-afire shows are now Chuck E. Cheese 3-Stage (3-Stages), which are also being dwindled down due to the [CEC 2018 2.0 Remodel Program]({{< ref "wiki/CEC 2018 20 Remodel Program.md" >}}). Creative Engineering would continue to use its spare shows to sell to family entertainment centers as-is, [retrofitted]({{< ref "wiki/Moonrockers.md" >}}), or with new additions such as video and karaoke throughout the 80's and 90's.
