The **_Rock-afire Explosion**_ was an animatronic show created by [[Creative Engineering]] for [[ShowBiz Pizza Place]] from 1980 to 1983, which would be used in its restaurants until ShowBiz started [[Concept Unification]] from 1989 to 1992.

Most remaining Rock-afire shows are now Chuck E. Cheese [\2](\1), which are also being dwindled down due to the [\2](\1), or with new additions such as video and karaoke throughout the 80's and 90's.
