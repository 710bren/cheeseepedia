The <b><i>Winchester Pizza Time Theatre Show</b></i> was a set of animatronics built exclusively for the first Pizza Time Theatre location at [San Jose, CA (370 S Winchester Blvd)]({{< ref "wiki/San Jose, CA (370 S Winchester Blvd).md" >}}) and used from May 17th, 1977 to sometime between 1980 and 1981 when they were replaced with [Cyberamics]({{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics.md" >}}).

The show consisted of the main characters and moving props placed along the bannisters of the showroom, with the [Warblettes]({{< ref "wiki/Winchester Warblettes (Animatronic).md" >}}) hung below the ceiling.

<h2> History </h2>
All characters were produced by [Fantasy Forest]({{< ref "wiki/Fantasy Forest.md" >}}), mainly by its owner Harold Goldbrandsen. Fantasy Forest was previously a mascot costume manufacturer, making the Winchester show their first animatronic products created.

Atari's Cyan Engineering (also known as the Grass Valley Team) would handle the creation of the [Winchester Control System]({{< ref "wiki/Winchester Control System.md" >}}), headed by Larry Emmons and Gary Waters.<ref>https://archive.org/details/atariincbusiness0000gold/page/328/mode/2up?q=theatre</ref>

<h2> Animatronics </h2>
The Chuck E. Cheese Proof of Concept Prototype (Animatronic) (Chuck E. Cheese Proof of Concept Prototype) was initially built as a concept piece for the location, but was never intended to be used inside the building.

The main animatronics and their locations were:
