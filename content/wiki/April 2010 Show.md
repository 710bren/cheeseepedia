## Trivia: ##
* There is no CEC TV logo for this show. Instead, the footage of the Studio C puppets appear on all versions of this show including those for Existing Stages.
* The AM/PM show schedule is discontinued starting with this show. Instead of swapping to a different set of segments, the show would play continuously from opening to closing.
* This was the first show released where the Studio C version would have the puppet footage be part of the main footage instead of separate.
* This was the only show that was specifically programmed for it's [Star Stage]({{< ref "wiki/Star Stage.md" >}}) equivalent which was being tested at the time.
* Due to the amount of content on the existing DVD the live shows had to be put on a seperate DVD. But allowed stores to use the January 2010 DVD for live shows. It is currently unknown what lives were on the DVD. 
* According to the _Valid Shows_ section of the newsletter it states that the 'January Show Floppy' was allowed but doesn't mention the DVD for Studio C.
* This is the only show in 2010 to have featured new content. 
* A brand new DVD #3 for Studio C was released for this show adding the current birthday show (Birthday 09), new diagnostics for 16m and 32m bots, <ref>http://www.showbizpizza.com/info/documents/cec/cec_dept18-2010-04.pdf</ref>
