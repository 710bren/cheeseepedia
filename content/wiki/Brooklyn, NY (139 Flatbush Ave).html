<p><b><i>Brooklyn, NY (139 Flatbush Ave), Store #522</b></i> is a Chuck E. Cheese's in the Atlantic Terminal mall that opened in 2004 with a Studio C 2000 and still operates to this day with the 2.0 remodel and Dance Floor.</p>
<p><h2> Stages </h2></p>
<p>As the store opened with Studio C 2000, Chuck E.'s stage, like other NYC area stores like Bronx and Harlem, had a rope barrier onstage to block kids from tampering with the animatronic as early as 2011. In 2014 this would be replaced with a barrier from the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Circles of Light" >}}">Circles of Light</a> stage. Otherwise the stage otherwise went unchanged aside from the prop removals mandated by corporate and the removal of the fixtures above the main screens.</p>
<p><h2>History</h2></p>
<p>On July 22, 2004 Chuck E. Cheese's opened on the second floor of the Atlantic Terminal shopping mall with the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Phase 3 (2000)" >}}">Phase 3 (2000)</a> games package alongside unique signage specific to this location.</p>
<p>This location was also one of the few locations to have the signage of Chuck E. pointing towards the entrance, which was later retrofitted to have Rockstar Chuck E.'s head.</p>
<p>The Brooklyn CEC failed a health inspection in June 2006 causing the store to temporarily close after being shut down by the health department. They were re-inspected a week later and cleared to reopened.<sup>[1]</sup> The store remained in the same condition with few minor changes they've remodeled for the first time in May of 2015 under the short-lived 2015 Remodel initiative. This included removal of dim lighting for fluorescent lighting, removal of all previous artworks, newly painted walls, and new d√©cor.</p>
<p>Early on into 2023, remodeled once again under the 2.0 remodel initiative and had its grand re-opening in April. This store also received the first Trampoline Zone which appears to be the new SkyTubes replacement.<sup>[2]</sup></p>
