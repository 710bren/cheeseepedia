A video detailing the creation of the tape, along with footage used to test the experiments, were released on the _Creative Engineering Premium Service_ on October 7, 2021, titled _The Brad Paisley Experiments._

##  Creation ## 
An employee of Brad Paisley contacted Creative Engineering in the Summer of 2021, requesting a few experiments to visualize the Rock-afire Explosion characters playing Brad's songs. The first experiment was of Billy Bob performing the song [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebrity_(Brad_Paisley_song) Celebrity] behind a green screen. The second was of the main stage playing [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebrity_(Brad_Paisley_song) Celebrity], and the third was of Mitzi performing behind a green screen with no cosmetics on, to see how her mechanisms moved while performing. Creative Engineering opted to test the last experiment with the [[Afterhours Tape]]. After the tests were performed and video footage sent over, the contact decided to decline on a current collaboration, but may work with _Creative Engineering_ in the future.
