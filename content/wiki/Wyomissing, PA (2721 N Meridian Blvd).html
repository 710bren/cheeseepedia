<b><i>2721 North Meridian Blvd, Store #539</b></i> was a <i>Chuck E. Cheese's</i> that opened on December 20th, 2000, as a corporate owned Chuck E. Cheese with a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Studio C Alpha" >}}">Studio C Alpha</a> and closed on September 15, 2024. It was located right across from the Broadcasting Square Shopping Mall.
When this store first opened, it opened with the 1998 C Cap logo and signage. It also opened with 1991, 1993, 1998, and 1999 d√©cor.
<h2> History </h2>
Wyomissing first opened as a freestanding building near the Broadcasting Square Shopping Mall in December 2000. The store debuted with the Studio C Alpha, featuring a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Chuck E Cheese 32m (Animatronic)" >}}">32M Chuck E. Cheese</a> animatronic and prop characters. This location did not receive the Phase 4 remodel during its almost 23 year run, but between October 2011 and November 2015, the awnings and CEC letter on the exterior were replaced with newer, modern ones seen in the Phase 4 and Phase 5 remodels. Between December 2016 and September 2017, the 1998 C Cap sign was replaced with the 2015 Waving Rockstar Chuck sign, completing this store's modern exterior remodel.
The interior would see an update probably around this time too. This would not impact the interior of the store, wall art wise. All of the gameroom and showroom walls were painted yellow, green, orange, and blue, which were the same wall colors from Phase 5. Interestingly, all of the 1990s wall decor (Must C TV award posters, Andy Warhol pop art posters, and Sports and Parody posters, Postcard posters, etc.) weren't removed during this remodel. This made the Wyomissing store half modern, and half old at the same time, which is interesting. Their Studio C Alpha stage has changed since the 2000s though. The outfit on the Chuck E. Cheese animatronic was either the late night outfit or the Cool Chuck outfit when this store first debuted, but later on their previous outfit was replaced with the newer Avenger outfit by the 2010s. The Bird and Pizza Phone prop bots were removed from the stage between May 2022 and sometime in 2023. The Apple TV on Chuck E.'s desk (not to be confused with the streaming box) has been red, but it's unknown if it has always been like that.
Unfortunately, Wyomissing closed permanently on September 15, 2024 due to leasing issues. A picture online showed that a letter from CEC Entertainment was given to an employee informing of the store's closure.<sup>(1)</sup> This closure would make Pennsylvania officially bot-less.
Originally, there was discussion between CEC and the leasing company about the Wyomissing location being relocated, so the store's former 2.0 remodel plans were postponed indefinitely until the discussion was sorted out. Unfortunately, it's likely these plans were dropped due to the store's permanent closure.
