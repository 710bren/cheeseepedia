The **U.S. News (Magazine)** was a poster created for Chuck E. Cheese's around 1994-1995 for the [1990s Major Remodel]({{< ref "wiki/1990s Major Remodel.md" >}}).

The poster is held in a 20Â½ in. by 17 in. dark blue/red picture frame. The main photo of the poster depicts the Chuck Statue - Uncle Sam (shelf item) which has Chuck E. Cheese in a Uncle Sam outfit with the U.S. themed hat & tuxedo. This magazine is a parody of the 1917 army poster 'I WANT YOU FOR U.S. ARMY' that features Uncle Sam.
