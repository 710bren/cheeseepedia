During mid 1999, Chuck E. Cheese's updated their walkaround head to add a new pair of ears where the inside was plastic instead of fur and lighter eye lids instead of the dark color seen in 98. Just like the 98 head, the bowtie holes are still present. Some 98 heads received replacement 99 ears so they can be up to the 99 standards.

This version was also seen <i>Galaxy 5000</i> movie, being used in specific background or faraway shots where the articulated heads would not receive the signals to operate.
