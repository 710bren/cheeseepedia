<p>The <b>Name That Cheese (CEC Décor)</b> was a poster created for Chuck E. Cheese's in 1998.</p>
<p><h2> Design </h2></p>
<p>This poster features Chuck E. Cheese hosting a game show called 'Name That Cheese' with the contestants being Mr. Munch, a lady, and a man named Doug with Helen being the assistant showing off the prize which is a piece of cheese. While in the audience, Jasper is being the camera operator and Pasqually is watching the show.</p>
<p><h2> Size/Dimensions </h2></p>
<p>Exact measurements are unknown, but this poster is exact same size as the SPT Décor.</p>
<p><h2> Reception </h2></p>
<p>The poster originally received generally positive reception upon release, however, as time passed, it began to get a more negative reception, with many critics of the Original Phase Trilogy using this as a literal poster child for showing how dated pre-2005 Chuck E. Cheese's stores are. Nowadays, it does have a cult following, either due to how absurd the poster is, or due to the 90s nostalgia boom.</p>
