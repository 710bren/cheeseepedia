<p><b><i>133-35 79th St, Store #649</b></i> is a Chuck E. Cheese that opened on January 31, 2022, with a Dance Floor.</p>
<p>This location was the first new store to open in the United States since the Kapolei, Hawaii location, which opened in October 2018.</p>
<p><h2> Stage </h2></p>
<p>As the store is a 2.0 location, they opened with a 2019 Dance Floor. The location swiftly became outdated due to staying untouched for months before opening. In September 2022 the location installed the Video Wall.</p>
<p><h2> History </h2></p>
<p><h3> Construction </h3></p>
<p>In October 2019 the clothing store that originally occupied the space, Kids Town, was announcing its closure--with CEC swiftly moving in and putting up a 'Coming Soon' sign with an older Chuck E. Cheese logo on its departure.</p>
<p>The location officially began construction between the store's closure and January 2020, conveniently when COVID19 quickly became an issue with mandates. By 2021 the location was mostly finished and ready to open but constant push backs caused the location be put into limbo until they slowly started to comeback from the pandemic.</p>
<p>The location was originally supposed to open in September 2021 before being put on hold because of COVID19. This was one of the issues happening with CEC at this point, with Parkway temporarily ceasing business with CEC for a few months due to the pandemic.</p>
<p><h3> Opening </h3></p>
<p>In 2022 when CEC was getting back on its feet to properly operate locations again, they finally settled for January 31, 2022, as an opening, with their grand opening being held on March 31, 2022. To accompany guests, the Chuck E. Cheese, Helen Henny, and Pasqually mascots star in the grand opening ceremony.</p>
