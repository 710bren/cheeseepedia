## History ##
In 1983 (month and day unknown), Windcrest's PTT opened to the public. It originally had a Balcony Stage. However, there is basically no documentation on when it was a PTT. In around 1989, they received the 1988 remodel, changing a lot. It involved unifying many counters and rooms, added checkers around the store, added neon signage, changed the exterior, and removed the Balcony Stage for presumably the first Chuck E.'s House Facade. In February 1992, they would receive a minor remodel, which involved removing the C-Stage for a 2-Stage. Around a few years later, possibly 1993-1996, they would receive , changing every aspect around the store. Also around this time, the cabaret and lounge areas would be removed. In December 2005 (day unknown), they would relocate to Selma, TX. The building would remain vacant until 2015-2016, when they would turn into a high school. As of July 2023, the school remains on the space.
