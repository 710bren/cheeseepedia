## History ##
Costa Mesa opened for the first time in 1981 (month and day unknown) with a Balcony Stage. Unfortunately, information on Costa Mesa as a PTT is scarce, but we do know they opened with Harmony Howlette as the guest star. They would later have Madame Oink and later Helen Henny. In 1984 (month and day unknown), it closed due to the March bankruptcy. The location would later reopen under the Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza banner on January 12, 1993 with a 2-Stage. They would later receive  in the mid 90s, and later  in Summer 1999, changing little, and removed the 2-Stage for a Studio C Alpha. The remodel would be confirmed to be finished in September. In 2006/2007, they would receive the 2005 update to the [2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative]({{< ref "wiki/2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration  Major Remodel Initiative.md" >}}), involving the removal of 90s decor, showroom walls, balcony seating, dim lighting, and replaced it with modern decor. Costa Mesa remains like this as of today.
