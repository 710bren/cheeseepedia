<b><i>Costa Mesa, CA (2300 Harbor Blvd), Store #421</b></i> is a <i>Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre/Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza</i>/<i>Chuck E. Cheese's</i> that opened in 1981 (month and day unknown) and closed in 1984 (month and day unknown) with a Balcony Stage. A new store would open in a different part of the plaza on January 12, 1993, with a 2-Stage. It then closed in 1999 and then relocated, reopening sometime in September of 1999 due to the plaza it was in being redeveloped and is still open today with the CEC 2018 2.0 Remodel Program (2.0 Remodel). It also had a very unique exterior, which included a backwards facing Thumb Chuck facing a forward one. The store is located in the Harbor Shopping Center.

<h2> Stages </h2>
Costa Mesa opened for the first time in 1981 with a [Balcony Stage]({{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage.md" >}}), and then closed in 1984. Chuck E. Cheese would be absent from Costa Mesa until 1993, when it opened in a new spot with a [2-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/2-Stage.md" >}}). In 1999, the 2nd location would close when the new store opened, removing the [2-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/2-Stage.md" >}}) and tearing down the building for Home Depot and other stores. The new store would open with a Studio C (1997) (Studio C Alpha), which would be removed around February 2024 during the store's 2.0 Remodel.

<h2> History </h2>
Costa Mesa opened for the first time in 1981 (month and day unknown) with a Balcony Stage. Unfortunately, information on Costa Mesa as a PTT is scarce, but we do know they opened with Harmony Howlette as the guest star. They would later have Madame Oink and later Helen Henny. In 1984 (month and day unknown), it closed due to the March bankruptcy. Chuck E. Cheese would then make a return to the city under the Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza banner on January 12, 1993, with a 2-Stage. They would later receive [Phase 1]({{< ref "wiki/Phase 1 (1994).md" >}}) in the mid 90s and would later receive the [Phase 2]({{< ref "wiki/Phase 2 (1997).md" >}}) game package a couple years later. Then they would close and relocate sometime around 1999, reopening the same year in September with the [Phase 3]({{< ref "wiki/Phase 3 (2000).md" >}}) game package with a Studio C Alpha. In 2006/2007, they would receive the 2005 update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative, involving the removal of 90s decor, showroom walls, balcony seating, dim lighting, and replaced it with modern decor. Around February of 2024, the store would undergo the [CEC 2018 2.0 Remodel Program]({{< ref "wiki/CEC 2018 20 Remodel Program.md" >}}), removing the show for a [Video Wall]({{< ref "wiki/Video Wall.md" >}}) and Chuck E. Live Stage (Dance Floor) (Dance Floor), and also received a new variation of the 2.0 booths, that look similar to the booths used in the Cool Chuck Remodels, which is how the store remains to this day.
