The **_Creative Engineering, Inc. Policy Manual**_ is a lost manual for CEI employees.

The only evidence of the manual's existence is a scan of the front cover art, drawn by Dave Thomas.<ref>https://www.showbizpizza.com/photos/rae/cei_artwork/index.html</ref> The manual was half-letter sized, being 8.5' x 5.5'.<ref></ref>

## Lost Media ##
The currently only known copy was located in _Snapper's Blast to the Past Museum_, which burned from a fog machine accident in October of 2010. The manual was not recovered from the rubble.<ref></ref><ref>https://youtu.be/cKBgbQXGEoI</ref>
