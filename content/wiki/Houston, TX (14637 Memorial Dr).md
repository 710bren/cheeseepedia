Around 2008-2009, this location had received the phase 4 remodel, which marked the end of the 3-Stage as it was removed to make way for a new Studio C Beta 16M movement bot which was apart of the remodel.

Over the years, this location was suffering from many issues, once of which being the crime rate at this location being high and the main issue being in an unsafe area since the place it was in was in an abandoned shopping center. Because of these issues this location was having, this location had planned a relocation to  at North Junction Plaza. Eventually it was decided that this location would be closing, as was originally going to close down around March 2018, but the closure date was delayed a couple of times up to the final date, August 26th, 2018. This location closed their doors for good on August 26th, 2018 and eventually reopened on September 1st, 2018 at . This former CEC still remains abandoned and vacant to this day.
