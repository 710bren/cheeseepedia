The 2-Stage would end up being removed not too long after, being replaced with a Studio C 2000 |Studio C Beta, 16M in January 2006. Starting with this store, Studio C Beta's and other Studio C's being installed after this would install the fake curtains to save money. After the 2-Stage removal, Pieces of the 2-Stage would end up being parted out to <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Newington, NH (30 Fox Run Rd)" >}}">Newington, NH (30 Fox Run Rd)</a>. The Gameroom and Showroom would end up being relocated for this remodel, as the Studio C would be placed in the former Gameroom at the front of the store, and the Gameroom would be in the former Showroom at the back of the store.</p>
