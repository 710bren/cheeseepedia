<h2>History</h2>
Manchester opened in August 1982 with a [Balcony Stage]({{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage.md" >}}), It is currently the oldest Chuck E. Cheese's location in New England.

Manchester housed the Balcony Stage from 1982 until 1989 when they would receive the 1988 Remodel and convert the Balcony into the [Chuck E.'s House Facade]({{< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House Facade.md" >}}). They also featured The King in the Cabaret Room. They Also had Dolli Dimples.   

In 1993, Manchester would receive the 1993 Remodel. They would convert the Chuck E.'s House Facade into a 2-Stage, as well as remove The King and Dolli  

In December 2005, Manchester would receive the [CEC 2005 Remodel Program]({{< ref "wiki/CEC 2005 Remodel Program.md" >}}). The 2-Stage would end up being removed not too long after, being replaced with a Studio C 2000  (Studio C Beta, 16M) in January 2006. Starting with this store, Studio C Beta's and other Studio C's being installed after this would install the fake curtains to save money. After the 2-Stage removal, Pieces of the 2-Stage would end up being parted out to [Newington, NH (30 Fox Run Rd)]({{< ref "wiki/Newington, NH (30 Fox Run Rd).md" >}}). The Gameroom and Showroom would end up being relocated for this remodel, as the Studio C would be placed in the former Gameroom at the front of the store, and the Gameroom would be in the former Showroom at the back of the store.  

In Spring 2011, Manchester would receive an expansion. The Showroom would be relocated to the back of the store where it originally was.  Also, the bathrooms would be relocated, as well as the entrance.  

In Fall 2020, Manchester would remove the Skytubes and Toddler Zone. due to COVID-19.  

In Spring 2022, Manchester would replace the Studio C head with Orange, CT's. The original head was destroyed.

On September 19th, 2022, Manchester's Studio C Ceased Programming.

In September 2023, Manchester started its 2.0 remodel. The Studio C Beta stage was removed and replaced with a Dance Floor and Video Wall, making the Dance Floor the only stage type in New Hampshire.

In April 2024, according to Chuck E. Cheese CEO David Mckillips on Instagram, Manchester, along with [Everett, MA]({{< ref "wiki/Everett, MA (29 Mystic View Rd).md" >}}), were confirmed to get Trampoline Zones. It is expected to be installed and ready to go by May 4th. 

<h2>Trivia</h2>
- This location has the 2.0 PTT Logo, like Northridge's, its not at the front of the store though, it is at the Back (?)
- This location also has the 'Make Magic' Sign even after the 2.0 remodel
