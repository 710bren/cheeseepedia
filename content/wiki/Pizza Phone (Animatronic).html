The <b><i>Pizza Phone</b></i> is an animatronic figure created by Garner Holt Productions, Inc. for Chuck E. Cheese's locations, manufactured from 1997-2001.

It was only used on the [Studio C Alpha]({{< ref "wiki/Studio C Alpha.md" >}}) stage, and was also used at [Jeddah, Saudi Arabia (Corniche Road)]({{< ref "wiki/Jeddah (Corniche Road), Saudi Arabia.md" >}}) on their unique [Studio C Beta Prototype]({{< ref "wiki/Studio C Beta Prototype.md" >}}).

<h2> History </h2>
The Pizza Phone was created by Garner Holt Productions in 1997 as part of the [Studio C Alpha]({{< ref "wiki/Studio C Alpha.md" >}}) stage, situated next to Chuck in the main booth. Pizza Phones would be installed from 1997-2002, alongside 2012 and 2015. In December of 2001, it would be installed in the [Jeddah, Saudi Arabia (Corniche Road)]({{< ref "wiki/Jeddah (Corniche Road), Saudi Arabia.md" >}}) location on their unique [Studio C Beta Prototype]({{< ref "wiki/Studio C Beta Prototype.md" >}}).
