<h2>History</h2>
Alexandria opened on November 20, 2010 with the [2005 Remodel]({{< ref "wiki/CEC 2005 Remodel Program.md" >}}) and a [Studio C Beta]({{< ref "wiki/Studio C Beta.md" >}}). Not much info is known about Alexandria in general due to lack of documentation. In July 2023, the store got 2.0, removing the Beta for a Dance Floor and Video Wall. As of August 2023, Alexandria is still open with 2.0.
