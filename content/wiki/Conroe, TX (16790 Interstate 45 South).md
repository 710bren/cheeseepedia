This was one of 21 Studio C 2000<nowiki/>s installed in Texas (One of 9 in Houston). When the store opened, they had the 1990s Major Remodel with Late 90s'-Early 2000's art pieces. The store at some point would receive the 2005 Update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative which was an interior only remodel. In April 2023, the store would receive the 2017 2.0 Remodel Program (2.0 Remodel) which involved the Studio C Beta being removed for a 2021 Model Dance Floor & Video Wall, this also involved the exterior being repainted for the first time. As of April 2023, Conroe still has the 2.0 Remodel and the 2021 Model Dance Floor & Video Wall
