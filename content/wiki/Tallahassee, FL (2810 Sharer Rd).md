**_2810 Sharer Rd**_ is a _Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza_ that opened on April 7, 1992 with a 3-Stage and is still in operation to this very day. Like very few stores, this location has not remodeled since the mid 1990s. They have a Phase 5 exterior, but they do have a Phase 3 exterior inside.

Despite having a 3-Stage, this location was not a former Showbiz Pizza, just like 's store when they opened a year earlier in December 1991.

## Stages ##
Tallahassee opened with a 3-Stage. Despite opening with one, this location was never a SPP, as they opened in 1992. As of 2023, the stage is in horrible condition, as most movements are broken, and the cosmetics are very dirty.
