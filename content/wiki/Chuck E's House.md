The **Rocker Stage** was a stage format found at Showbiz Pizza and Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre locations from February 1st, 1987 to June 12, 2022. It was the first stage to give Chuck E., Helen, and Jasper legs, while Munch and Pasqually remained half-bodied. This was the first stage to have the house theme, being outside of the house. The Rocker Stage would debut at the  location on February 1st, 1987, and would go extinct at the  location on June 12, 2022, when they would remove it for their 2.0 remodel.

* Rockford, Illinois had the last Rocker Stage from 2008 until June 2022, when they would remove the stage for their 2.0 remodel, the space where it was is now just a wall, with the Video Wall being put into the wall next to it on the left.
* Simi Valley, California had the second last Rocker Stage, before closing in 2008, leaving Rockford to be the last Rocker Stage ever.
* Florence, Kentucky had 4th last Rocker Stage, they replaced the Helen bot from the porch swing to the standard CU variant in 2000, and then replaced the stage with the 2-Stage from Hampton, Virginia in 2002, which had closed and relocated around that time. Florence would later receive the 2.0 remodel in March 2022, leaving no more Munch's Make Believe Band stages in Kentucky.
