The <b><i>General Cinema Corporation's Summer Movie Camp Commercial</b></i> is a lost Chuck E. Cheese's commercial advertising the 2001 Summer Movie Camp deal at select movie theatre locations.

It is theorized to advertise the free admission to a <i>General Cinema's</i> Summer Movie Camp event with any purchase of a Super Server Meal at CEC, using a similar ad from 2001 in the [CEC Coca-Cola Triple Tabletop Ad Stand]({{< ref "wiki/CEC Coca-Cola Triple Tabletop Ad Stand.md" >}}).
