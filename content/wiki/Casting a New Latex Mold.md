## Rock-afire Mask Color Formula ##
The following is the former official formula used for the masks of Rolfe, Dook, Beach Bear, Mitzi, and Billy Bob<ref></ref> This formula was only used in the early days of manufacturing and was replaced with more sophisticated color layering methods, possibly some time after Ray was hired to manage airbrushing.<blockquote>Each color is 2 oz. tubed acrylic to ¼ cup of water.

* Yellow Ochre - ⅓ Cup
* Cadmium Orange - ⅓ Cup
* Cadmium Red Medium - ¼ Cup
* Burnt Sienna - ¼ Cup.
* Titanium White - 2¼ Cup

To rubberize paint, mix 1 part paint to 1¼ part latex rubber.</blockquote>
