The **_Four Little Shavers**_ are an animatronic cabaret act used in _Pizza Time Theatre_ restaurants.

They appeared in 5 known locations, these being the _Pizza Time Theatres_ in _Tampa (Carrollwood), Florida_, _San Antonio, Texas_, _Brandon, Florida_, _Clearwater, Florida_<ref> https://www.newspapers.com/article/tampa-bay-times/38822127/</ref>, and _Daytona Beach, Florida_.<ref> https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-orlando-sentinel/132950614/</ref>  They were first installed in August 1981 at the _Tampa (Carrollwood), Florida_ location. They appeared in a room named the Ice Cream Emporium which was an Ice Cream bar, a concept tested by _Pizza Time Theatre Inc._ at the time. The show was fully phased out of these stores by the mid 1980's. All 5 sets were presumed to be destroyed, but one set has been discovered, restored and now performs at the _Volo Museum (Volo Auto Museum)_ in _Volo, Illinois._

There were 4 members of this band, Nolan (holding the towel), O'Nolan (holding the cup), Curly (the bald man in the chair) and McNolan (holding the broom). They were similar to the Beagles / Beach Bowsers (Lounge) (Beagles/Beach Bowsers) in terms of mechanisms and general appearance.

## Placement ##
In the standard installation of the show detailed in the _Pizza Time Theatre Theatrical Standards Manual_, the characters would stand in a line, the order being Nolan, O'Nolan, Curly, McNolan (from left to right) in front of a barber shop themed scene. This featured a desk, bottles, mirrors and a barber pole at the back. However one of the locations had a different design, which had a black and blue backdrop with shelving and bottles painted onto it and a sign reading 'Lou's Place', and had Nolan moved to the far right of the stage.


## Showtapes ##
No showtapes have been found yet for the _Four Little Shavers._ However the _Theatrical Standards Manual_ details that they would sing songs from the _Buffalo Bills_ and some other Barber Shop Groups.

Their Body Sway movements are accomplished using the exact same assembly used by the [Warblettes]({{< ref "wiki/Warblettes (Cyberamic).md" >}}), except with only the middle head used. It starts with them tilted left and the cylinder will push them over so they are tilted to the right. Only Curly has mechanical arms which can move, the other three have tubes that connect to props (e.g. McNolan's arm tubes connect to his broom) which can move about as they move to give the illusion of there being arms.

Curly is supposed to have 3 total arm movements but at the Volo Show, only one of them seems to be operational (Right Arm Twist). The Arm Up movement is nonoperational, possibly from a bad cylinder. The Left Arm Twist movement is entirely absent, with the left arm being made of foam and thin metal strips.This movement was possibly added after Volo's Curly was produced.



They are very similar to the Beagles / Beach Bowsers (Lounge) (Beagles/Beach Bowsers) mechanisms since they use the same design and system.
