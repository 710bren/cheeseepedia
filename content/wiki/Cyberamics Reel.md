The **_Maxell UD 35-90 7' reel**_ is a reel-to-reel sound recording tape that was used for all showtapes on the [[Cyberamic Control System]]. 

The tape itself was produced with a trans-black plastic shell, with 1800ft of tape spooled around it. The Cyberamic signals and showtape audio would be recorded into the left and right channels on the tape, making the audio only in mono when played through the stage speakers.
