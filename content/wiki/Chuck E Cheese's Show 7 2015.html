<h2> Trivia: </h2>

* The '(Live at Chuck E. Cheese's)' Intermission was filmed at the Natick, MA Chuck E. Cheese's on June 29th 2015.
* Share The Joy (2014) exists in its entirety on the Studio C SD DVD however the show is programmed to loop back to Intermission 1 before it ever plays.
* Before 'What Do You Get a Sasquatch for Christmas?' and 'Snowman' feature small clips of the Acts format. 'What Do You Get a Sasquatch for Christmas?' Shows the act from after Munch says 'Look at all this snow out here' and 'Snowman' shows the act from once they're viewing the Snowman.

* Holiday 2015 was reedited and refilmed to fix the errors created by the removal of the act format and changes with certain characters being used. The main shot featuring the whole band singing was refilmed to give Pasqually back his mustache. Along with that all footage showing off Nigel and Betty was removed. The show was completely reedited to remove all footage showing Pasqually with no mustache and all full and up-close shots of Nigel/Betty.
* This was the final showtape to feature the Department 18 logo on the Showtape DVDs. Starting with Show 1 2016 it was removed and no mention of it has been seen since.
