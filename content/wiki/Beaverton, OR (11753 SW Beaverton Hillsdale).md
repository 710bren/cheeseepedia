This location opened in October 1981 (day unknown) as the first Chuck E. Cheese in Oregon. As most other PTTs at the time, they had the [\2](\1). Unfortunately, basically no documentation exists on this location. The location closed permanently around July 1985 for unknown reasons, but likely due to it underperforming. As of July 2023, the location is now Trader Joe's.
