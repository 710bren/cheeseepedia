<b><i>Me & My Friends (New Countdown)</b></i> is an updated rerelease of the [Me & My Friends]({{< ref "wiki/Me & My Friends.html" >}}) live show from 2017.

This version cuts the <i>Ticket Splash</i>, alongside redoing the initial countdown of the show.

<h2> Summary </h2>
The show is a listing of Chuck E.'s friends and their attributes, with Chuck E. and the audience mimicking them in the dance. Helen is brought up first, with the audience instructed to 'flap their wings'. Pasqually is next, where the audience's hands are instructed to spin pointing up, mimicking the tossing of pizza dough. Then comes Munch, where an arm gesture is made to resemble a jaw 'munching' on food. Jasper comes next, where the audience pretends to scratch like a dog. Chuck then refers to himself, stating the audience to 'wiggle their ears' like him by waving their hands on top of their head. After this lesson of the dance moves, they are done in rapid succession to a song alongside spinning and the audience waving their hands to each side. Chuck E. concludes that since the audience now knows of his friends, the song can end.
