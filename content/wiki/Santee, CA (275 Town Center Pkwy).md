**275 Town Center Parkway** is a future Chuck E. Cheese located in Santee, California, which is a suburb in San Diego's East County. The Santee store may be a possible relocation for the  location, as La Mesa is 15 minutes from the future Santee store. Santee will be the first 2.0 in the San Diego area, and will be the newest CEC to open in California since Los Angeles (2706 Wilshire Blvd) opened in April 2014 ( reopened as CEC in July 2022, so they are not new to CEC)

## History ##

### Pre-CEC ???-2023 ###
Before development on the CEC in Santee started, the space was a Hometown Buffet which, according to Google Maps reviews, closed in 2017. The Hometown Buffet received generally poor reviews, with the restaurant sitting at a 3.0 stars. The store would stay vacant for several years after closing, with a Google Street View from January 2022 still showing the Hometown Buffet sign still on the building.

### CEC 2023-Present ###
In January 2023, a bid appeared on Parkway Construction's (the company that does the 2.0 Remodels) website that stated 'Chuck E. Cheese New Store' in Santee, CA. An article from SanDiegoVille.com titled 'First New Age Chuck E. Cheese Location Set To Open In San Diego' states that the Santee store will open as early as Summer 2023.

## Stages ##
When the store opens, they will feature a Chuck E. Live Stage and Video Wall. The Santee store will be the first 2.0 in San Diego County.
