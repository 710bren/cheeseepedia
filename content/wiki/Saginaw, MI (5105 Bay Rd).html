<p><h2>History</h2></p>
<p>Saginaw opened on October 13th, 1982 as the 2nd ShowBiz Pizza store in Michigan (2nd after <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Southgate, MI (15300 Toledo Rd)" >}}">Southgate, MI (15300 Toledo Rd)</a>) with a Rock-afire Explosion show. It was originally and currently, a corporate owned store. They would later end up receiving the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/SPT 1988 Remodel Program" >}}">SPT 1988 Remodel Program</a> removing the old Showbiz decor, and adding newer decor. In 1991, Saginaw received Concept Unification which removed the Rock-afire for the 3-Stage and removed all Showbiz decor, added new decor, and a change to the exterior. Saginaw underwent another remodel in the Late 90's which involved the removal of the Neon Signage, Blue and White Awnings, some checkers around the store, another exterior change, and the removal of the 3-Stage for the Studio C Alpha. In 2006-2007, Saginaw received the 2005 Update of the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative which removed all 1990's store art, Balcony Seating, Showroom Walls, another change to the exterior and expanded the store, and adding purple walls. In August 2019, Saginaw received the 2.0 remodel which removed the Alpha for the Dance Floor. As of June 2024, Saginaw still has the 2.0 Remodel and Dance Floor.</p>
<p><h2>Stages</h2></p>
<p>Originally when the store opened, they had a Rock-afire Explosion, as all other Showbiz locations had.

In August 2019, Saginaw received 2.0 and the Alpha was removed for the Dance Floor.</p>
