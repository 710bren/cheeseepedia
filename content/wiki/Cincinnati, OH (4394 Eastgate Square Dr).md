**_Cincinnati, OH (4394 Eastgate Square Dr)**_ was a _Chuck E. Cheese's_ that opened in late July or early August 1990 with a Rocker stage,

It was a franchise store owned by ' Family Entertainment, Inc' which was eventually bought by corp on August 25, 2008. The store also replaced the rocker stage with a Studio C Beta in 2006. 

## Stages: ##
Opened up with a Rocker Stage in 1990 receiving barely any updates or maintenance after being installed. As shown in a 1998 video of the store the show already barely worked with Helen for example having only two movements out of the total eight movement<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRZH6lOgSbw</ref>. Helen was also one of the last PTT Helen masks being used as she still had it in 2002. But by 2003 had been removed and replaced by the standard 90s Helen mask design.<ref>https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1104755625678&set=a.1268012426996&type=3&mibextid=2DNWWX&fs=e&s=cl</ref> It is rumored that the animatronics were replaced with [Florence, KY (7635 Mall Rd)]({{< ref "wiki/Florence, KY (7635 Mall Rd).md" >}}) original show but since this is not coming from a verified source, this information is to be taken with a grain of salt.

Soon after in late 2005/Early 2006 Eastgate received its first remodel getting rid of the Rocker stage and replacing it with (at the time) the brand new third update to the Studio C Cappa which did have working curtains (although unknown if they were ever used). The stage remained mostly untouched until 2014 when the stage was modified to remove the blue screen and several lighting fixtures. It was replaced with what early 2010s stores got although missing most of the display and having the bottom lights stuck on and the 'CEC' sign just stuck on the wall above the TVs. In 2017 the store trashed the curtains and the animatronic got rockstar pants in 2018. From 2018 - current day not much has been done to the show with the stage changing between barely working and working well every few months.
