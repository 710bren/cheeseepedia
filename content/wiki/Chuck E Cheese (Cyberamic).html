<p>The <b><i>Chuck E. Cheese <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics" >}}">Cyberamics</a></b></i> were a set of Cyberamics produced by <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Pizza Time Theatre" >}}">Pizza Time Theatre</a> as an animatronic version of <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Chuck E Cheese" >}}">Chuck E. Cheese</a> from 1979 to 1983 as a replacement for the Fantasy Forest bots. The bots would be later produced by Kinetix Group Inc from 1991-1993 and Animation World from 1993-1997.</p>
<p>The bots are very simple, having only 8 movements. The bots were originally controlled using the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Cyberamic Control System" >}}">Cyberamic Control System</a>, but were later changed to the Cyberstar system & <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Navori System" >}}">Navori System</a>.</p>
<p><h2> History </h2></p>
<p><h3> Production </h3></p>
<p>The animatronics were first developed by PTT Inc. as a replacement for the Original <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Fantasy Forest" >}}">Fantasy Forest</a> Bots, due to the FF bots being hand made & not cost effective.</p>
<p><h3> Pizza Time Theatre </h3></p>
<p>in the Late 1980's.]]</p>
<p>In 1979, The first Cyberamic Chuck E. Cheese was installed at the Pizza Time Theatre in <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Concord, CA (1975 Diamond Blvd)" >}}">Concord, CA (1975 Diamond Blvd)</a> on a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Portrait  Shelf Stage" >}}">Cyberamics Portrait Stage</a>, with several more bots following. Early Chuck Cyberamics, such as the one at <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Sacramento (Florin Mall), CA (7020 Stockton Blvd)" >}}">Florin Mall</a>, had cosmetics more reminiscent of prototype iterations of the character seen at <a href="{{< ref "wiki/San Jose, CA (370 S Winchester Blvd)" >}}">Winchester</a> and <a href="{{< ref "wiki/San Jose, CA (1371 Kooser Rd)" >}}">Kooser</a>.</p>
<p>In 1979, Fantasy Forest would produce a Cyberamic Chuck Costume. In early to mid 1980, due to Nolan Bushnell's commitment to The Great American Smoke-Out, all existing & future Cyberamic Chuck bots would have their Cigars removed.</p>
<p>In May 1980, A Cyberamic Chuck bot was placed on the Balcony Stage of the Pizza Time Theatre on <a href="{{< ref "wiki/San Jose, CA (1371 Kooser Rd)" >}}">San Jose, CA (1371 Kooser Rd)</a><sup>[1]</sup>.</p>
<p>In 1983, a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/The King  King Kat (Lounge)" >}}">King</a>-styled Cyberamic Chuck E. Cheese, Known as <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Half-A-Chuck (Cyberamic)" >}}">the Half-A-Chuck bot</a>, was built as a prototype. It was later given to the Foothill College Electronics Museum in San Jose, California. In November of that same year, PTT would cease it's manufacturing of bots and operate its Cyberamics division as a maintenance facility only.</p>
<p>At an unknown time Pre-Merger, A PTT location replaced their Chuck costume's head with a Cyber Chuck head.</p>
<p><h3> Chuck E. Cheese's </h3></p>
<p>In 1987, The first public version of the full body Chuck bot was used for the Chuck E.'s House stage from the Pizza Time Theater at <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Arlington, TX (2216 S Fielder Rd)" >}}">Arlington, TX (2216 S Fielder Rd)</a>. The bot was Arlington's Chuck bot with newly installed legs. Showbiz Pizza Time would continue to install legs to existing bots along with creating new parts to bots like a Tux outfit. It is important to note that Showbiz Pizza Time did not add any movements to Cyberamics when they were given legs for the newer stages.</p>
<p>The Last Bot to be put on a Pizza Time Players stage was at the CEC on <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Warwick, RI (1245 Bald Hill Rd)" >}}">Warwick, RI (1245 Bald Hill Rd)</a> in Late 1990.</p>
<p>In 1991, Showbiz Pizza Time Inc. would commission Kinetix Group Inc. to develop new Cyberamics for their stores.</p>
<p>In 1992, 2-Stages & 1-Stages would be installed at several new & old CEC stores, this included installing more legs for existing Chuck bots & the production of new bots by Kinetix Group. In 1993, Kinetix Group Inc. would stop production of new bots & SPT would instead hire Animation World for future bots. In 1997, Animation World would stop production of new bots due to the creation of the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Studio C Alpha" >}}">Studio C Alpha</a> stage type. Showbiz would continue to produce new cosmetics & parts for existing stores. In 2002, the Cool Chuck outfit was released to replace the tuxedoes. In 2008, the Avenger outfit for animatronics was released. Sometime around 2013/2014, CEC Entertainment Inc. would develop the last change to Cyber Chucks cosmetics, being a new Rockstar outfit for Cyber Chucks. In 2017, with the new <a href="{{< ref "wiki/CEC 2018 20 Remodel Program" >}}">2.0 Remodel</a>, several Cyber Chucks would be removed from locations.</p>
<p><h2> Design </h2></p>
<p><h3> Base </h3></p>
<p>The Cyberamic Chuck's have grey fur with a pink Mussel. They have Bucked Teeth, a black nose, & blue and yellow eyes. Early bots had a larger smile & more outward dimples. Later bots changed this for less outward dimples and changed the type of fabric used on the snouts and jaws from terry cloth to a t-shirt like material. Early bots had cigars, though in 1980, they were removed.</p>
<p><h3> Suit </h3></p>
<p>Most of the Cyberamic Chuck's suits were just the suit design of the mascot Chuck E. Cheese, though, a Bandstand outfit would be created in the 1980's for the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Bandstand I" >}}">Bandstand I</a> & <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Bandstand II" >}}">II</a> Showtapes.</p>
<p><h2> Movements </h2></p>
<p>The bot features 8 movements in total.</p>
