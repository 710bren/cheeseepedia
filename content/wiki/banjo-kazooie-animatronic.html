<b><i>Banjo & Kazooie</b></i> is an animatronic created by an unknown manufacturer for use in a 1998 commercial for the game Banjo Kazooie.
<br>
The animatronic consists of two sections, a stationary prop of Banjo, whom is depicted like a realistic bear in a dangling pose, and the moving Kazooie, whom can flap their wings, move their head, move their eyelids, and use their jaw.

<h2>History</h2>
The animatronic would be used for two shots in it's produced commercial, one being of Banjo and Kazooie swooping in on the main characters, and a wide shot of them flying in the distance. Other shots show Banjo grabbing and holding onto one of the characters, but it is unclear if this is puppeteered by another prop, or still used by the main animatronic. <sup>(1)</sup>
<br>
The Kazooie part of the bot would surface in 2025 after being purchased by a collector. Portions of the Banjo section are seen, but the bear prop was not part of the current state of the animatronic.<sup>(2)</sup>
