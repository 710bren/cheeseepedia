<h2> History </h2>

It featured a [Circles of Light, 16m]({{< ref "wiki/Circles of Light.md" >}}) and the 2010 update to the  2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative. The store remained mainly untouched since opening, besides the removal of the [Skytubes]({{< ref "wiki/Skytubes.md" >}}). As of August 2023, Melrose Park remains like this.
