<h2> History </h2>
Melrose Park opened in September 2012 as the relocation of the old store on North Avenue. It featured a [[Circles of Light|Circles of Light, 16m]] and the 2010 update to the  2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative. The store remained mainly untouched since opening, besides the removal of the [Skytubes]({{< ref "wiki/Skytubes.html" >}}). As of August 2023, Melrose Park remains like this.
