**_6255 Fairview Ave**_ was a Showbiz Pizza Place that opened on July 1, 1983 (date may not be correct) with a Rock-Afire Explosion.

This location received CU in the early 1990's, and would have the 3-Stage until they got 2.0 in August 2022.

As of December 2022, they still have the 2.0 Remodel.

## History## 
TODO
## Stages## 
Originally when the store opened, they had a Rock-Afire Explosion, as all other Showbiz locations did. They would have it for a few years, until around 1991, when they would undergo Concept Unification, this was the process used to turn the RAE into the CEC characters. In August 2022, they remodeled to 2.0, removing the 3-Stage for a 2021 Model Dance Floor & Video Wall. The store reopened October 26, 2022<ref>https://idahonews.com/news/local/chuck-e-cheese-in-boise-to-reopen-on-wednesday</ref>.
