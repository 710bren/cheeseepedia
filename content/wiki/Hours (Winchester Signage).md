The **_Winchester Hours Signage**_ was only used at the first Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre on  located in the Town & Country Shopping Center in San Jose, California; for the sake of informing customers on the operational hours of the restaurant from 1977 to an unknown year. 

## Production ##
Specific data on the production on the sign is non-existent outside of speculation, however we can assume it was either produced by the Atari sub-division of Warner Communications Incorporated or produced by a contracting company specializing in store signage from possibly January through May 1977.

## Usage ##
The fixture would be used on the main entrance of the 370 South Winchester Boulevard from May 1977 to an unknown year, possibly 1981 when Winchester received the 1981 remodel. If the sign was not taken out in the 1981 remodel, it was most likely kept until closure in February 1985 and thrown out.

## Design ##
Data on the design of the fixture is scarce, however it can be made out that the text is yellow, and the main base of the sign is potentially black. We can fill out what the hours text displayed from the 1977 Pizza Time Theatre Program brochure, the hours being from _11:00 AM to 12:00 PM_ on Tuesdays thru Thursdays, _11:00 AM to 2:00 AM_ on Friday and Saturday, and _3:00 PM thru 12:00_ PM on Sunday.
