The **_Concept Unification Stage**_, or most commonly known as the **_3-Stage**_, is a stage setup usually found at former ShowBiz Pizza Place locations that underwent Concept Uninfication in the early 1990's. 

## History ##
After the [Concept Unification Prototype Stage]({{< ref "wiki/Concept Unification Prototype Stage.md" >}}) failed, it was decided that the band format of The Rock-afire Explosion would be kept. Starting in November 1989 with the first conversion at the Dallas (Montfort), TX location, Every Rock-afire show was converted to Munch's Make Beleive Band by the next three years. 

The 3-Stages have been prime targets for removal since the mid 1990's. In August 1996, the [Awesome Adventure Machine]({{< ref "wiki/Awesome Adventure Machine.md" >}}) was installed at Montfort, the same store where the first CU conversion occured. After the AAM failed, Studio C was tested in 1997, and officially rolled out in 1998. Between 1998-2000, about 50 3-Stages were removed and replaced with [Studio C Alphas]({{< ref "wiki/Studio C Alpha.md" >}}). After the Alpha stopped being produced, a handfull of 3-Stages were replaced by [Studio C Betas]({{< ref "wiki/Studio C Beta.md" >}}), and later [Studio C Cappas]({{< ref "wiki/Studio C Cappa.md" >}}).
