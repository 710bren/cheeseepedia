<b>Johnstown, PA (1523 Scalp Ave)</b> was a Showbiz Pizza Place that opened in 1982 with a [Classic Stage]({{< ref "wiki/Classic Stage.html" >}}), and closed in 1989. Little info is known about this location except for a few articles.

<h2> History </h2>
Johnstown opened in 1982 with a Rock-Afire Explosion. It had everything a normal Showbiz Pizza would have to offer. They did not receive the [SPT 1988 Remodel Program]({{< ref "wiki/SPT 1988 Remodel Program.html" >}}) with the Camp Ground Stage. In 1989, the location caught fire and closed. Consequently, the business would move down the road to the Bel Air Plaza and open <b>'Showplace Pizza</b>' in 1989.  Not much is known about [[Johnstown, PA (850 Scalp Ave)|Showplace Pizza]], other than it kept the Rock-afire Explosion (Presumably from 1523 Scalp Ave) and was most likely created in refusal to undergo Concept Unification. Showplace Pizza would later close in 1994.
