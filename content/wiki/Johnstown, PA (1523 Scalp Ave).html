<b>Johnstown, PA (1523 Scalp Ave)</b> was a Showbiz Pizza Place that opened in 1982 with a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Classic Stage" >}}">Classic Stage</a>, and closed in 1989. Little info is known about this location except for a few articles.

<h2> History </h2>
Johnstown opened in 1982 with a Rock-Afire Explosion. It had everything a normal Showbiz Pizza would have to offer. They did not receive the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/SPT 1988 Remodel Program" >}}">SPT 1988 Remodel Program</a> with the Camp Ground Stage. In 1989, the location caught fire and closed. Consequently, the business would move down the road to the Bel Air Plaza and open <b>'Showplace Pizza</b>' in 1989.  Not much is known about <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Johnstown, PA (850 Scalp Ave)" >}}">Showplace Pizza</a>, other than it kept the Rock-afire Explosion (Presumably from 1523 Scalp Ave) and was most likely created in refusal to undergo Concept Unification. Showplace Pizza would later close in 1994.
