**_370 South Winchester Blvd. San Jose, CA**_ was the first _Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre_ that opened on May 17th 1977 as apart of a deal between Pizza Time Theatre Corp. and their parent company (at the time) Warner Brothers Inc. Winchester would feature the Winchester PTT Show and would close permanently in February 1985.
##Stage##
When Winchester originally opened in May, it featured the V1 Chuck E. Cheese and Crusty models alongside Pasqually, Jasper, the Warblettes, Clapper Board, Flag Wavers and The Pizza Time Orchestra. The guest star frame remained in the store, although blanked out at the time. The more advanced guest star bot would be delivered to the store on August 12, 1977, ending the run of the original premiere showtape. The guest star's frame differed slightly, having a protruding portrait frame to bring attention to the character. Around June of 1978, the V2 versions of Crusty and Chuck E. Cheese would be installed. Around 1979, V2 Crusty was taken out of the show in favor of the installation of the new character, Mr. Munch, which would have him pop out of his own set of doors similar to Pasqually. When programming for Winchester/Kooser bots were discontinued, Winchester would play the showtapes they already had on hand over until they got Cyberamics. The portrait bots' condition during this brief time was described as being beaten up. Between 1980-1981, Winchester would replace all of their bots with the Cyberamic model.
###Guest Stars###
Upon opening, the first showtape that premiered upon opening was the [https://decodedocdigitize.miraheze.org/wiki/Pizza_Time_Theatre_Showtape Pizza Time Theatre Showtape]. It featured the regular cast of Pizza Time Players but but was absent of any Guest Star appearance. The first guest star premiered on August 12, 1977 starring Helen Henny and Crusty. In August 1977, the spot would be filled up with Foxy Collen and a new showtape to boot. Helen Henny would once again return to the store in November 1978. Madam Oink would then come back yet again to wrap up the dedicated Portrait programming in May 1979. These shows would be played on loop until the store got their Cyberamics. Winchester's exact guest star wareabouts following the Cyberamic installation are unknown.
##History##
Development of Winchester as a location dates back to 1976 under the name 'The Big Cheese', 'Pizza Game Center', etc. The venue was planned to be a 6,000 square foot venue with 2 arcades and a casino lounge. A total of 43,106 dollars (223,900 adjusting for inflation) worth of games and rides were purposed alongside the Mood Box and a Theatre Program. The rest of the document documents budget estimates for aspects of the store. The 2nd location (Kooser) was also being planned alongside Winchester at the time. The spot chosen would be a 5,000 square foot building that Security Pacific Bank was moving out of. By January 18th, 1977, the plans for Winchester were sent to the County of Santa Clara and were approved with minor changes suggested by the county. On March 3rd, The Planning Commission gave the go-ahead to Warner Brothers inc. (then both Atari and PTT inc's owners) to begin construction. Kooser was also being proposed around this time, having it's location being voted on by the Planning Commission of San Jose.
###Opening###
An ad campaign was launched in local newspapers and radio stations weeks before opening to generate hype. Winchester would host a series of press preview parties days before the public opening where select members of the press and vip members were invited out to see Winchester early. On May 15th, 1977, Winchester opened to the public for the first time and became an instant hit amongst the local community. Working animatronics were never seen outside of Disneyland, creating a novelty that drew people in. Often, on weekends, the place would be at max capacity with a line outside reaching around the sidewalk.
###Post-Opening###
As time moved on, Winchester would receive a large amount of guest visiting every weekend, having their facility at max capacity most of the weekends.  However, when Kooser opened in 1979, a large majority of potential and current Pizza Time Theatre customers moved to the bigger and updated store. Although Winchester still had a sizable guest count and loyal patrons, however new guests were few and far between. Winchester would remain on that status, although being deemed unprofitable.
###Closure###
Around February 1985, Winchester would close permanently for unknown reasons, however it can be attributed towards the slow decline of guests over the years. The building would remain vacant although still in good care. On May 8th, 1985 a new Chinese restaurant named 'Ocean Harbor Chinese Restaurant' was proposed to go on the site of the former PTT. It would take several years of development with the renovation (including the interior and exterior) beginning construction on April 13, 1987. It would remain open during the 90's, closing at an unknown date. In 2002, the building was demolished completely.
