<p><h2>History</h2></p>
<p>Flint opened on December 3rd, 1982, as the seventh Showbiz Pizza Place in Michigan originally as a corporate-owned store and was a free-standing building. Flint originally featured the Rock-afire Explosion, as all other Showbiz locations did. Flint would have it for a decade with the only change in 1988-1989 is the removal of older SPP decor for newer decor, and the change to the Billy Bob stage layout. In 1991, Flint would undergo Concept Unification and received the 1988 Remodel removing all traces of SPP like the exterior and decor, adding newer decor, the blue and white awning, the checkers, and replacing the ball pit with CEC's Ball Crawl ball pit. In the mid 90's, Flint received a minor remodel removing older decor for newer decor, and an exterior layout change. Flint would receive the Phase 2 Remodel in the late 90's removing older decor for newer decor, removing the ball pit for SkyTubes and Toddler Zone, and changed the exterior logo. Flint would then receive the 2010 update to the 2003 Remodel in 2011 removing older decor for newer decor, removed Showroom Walls, Balcony Seating, and relocated the stage, redoing the entrance, and relocating the salad bar. Flint would remain like this until June 25th, 2020, when it would permanently close due to it being listed as one of 61 store closures for the chain's bankruptcy. After it closed, the store was gutted and then remained abandoned until in 2022 when it would be demolished for a new place. Currently, as of right now, the place is now a Tommy's Express Car Wash, which is still operating today.</p>
<p>It is most likely that Chuck E. Cheese won't come back to Flint, Michigan for a while due to the city having high crime rates and even being ranked as one of the most violent and dangerous cities in the United States. The closest store would be in Saginaw, Michigan, which is 40 minutes away from Flint's old store address.</p>
