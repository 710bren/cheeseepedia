**_Columbus, OH (4284 Macsway Ave)**_ is a _Chuck E. Cheese's_ location running from 1982 to 2020.


talk here about it starting as a showbiz, some notable transitions, and where it lay dead now. Just a quick good summary of whats notable

## Stages ##
a discussion about the stages and when they transitioned

## History ##
notable history, but any big events like a car crashing into the building or someone dying or like something actually cool happening to one of these stores make a seperate header above this. 

### sub header ###
events should be segmentable using subheaders since there's possibly a lot of history. Feel free to segment stuff like key moments, phases, stage changes, ect

## Home Videos ##
gonna be links to pages from , but feel free to just link the direct videos here and we'll sort out the pages later. 'Home Videos' are specifically videos shot on the location **_before**_ YouTube was a thing. Best to note since old camcorder videos are harder to come by, with nowadays there being like a million billion videos of locations being published every single day.

## YouTube Videos ##
These are any videos found of the location on youtube in modern day. Just link directly to the video and give a date, don't worry about making any pages. This is also good, just like the home videos, for making direct citations to claims made in the history section, and if anything notable in the video shows something about its history, it should be described.
