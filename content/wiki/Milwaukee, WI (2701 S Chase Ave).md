**_2701 S Chase Ave**_ is a _Chuck E. Cheese's_ that opened in April 1983 with a Balcony Stage. 

Milwaukee was a former _Pizza Time Theatre_, and was the third to open in the state. It was one of the select few stores that got the Cheese E. Street concept, and was also the last store to feature it as it was removed more than ten years after the location opened in 1995. The location is currently still open, and features a 1-Stage with a turntable, and still retains the show room walls and balcony even after remodeling in 2015. 
##Stages##
Milwaukee opened with the Balcony Stage and featured the Cheese Crawl underneath compared to the usual Mr. Munch’s Magic Madhouse. In 1990, Milwaukee received a C-Stage, and in 1994, received a 1-Stage with a turntable, that is still in operation to this very day. Over the years, updates to the show included new masks in 2001 and 2002, and the eventual replacement of Chuck E.’s tuxedo with the Cool Chuck outfit, that is still on the show today. 
##History##
As previously mentioned, Milwaukee was one of the first stores to receive and open with Cheese E. Street in their game room. Cheese E. Street was removed by 1995.
As for cabaret acts, Milwaukee is known to have had The King. There is currently no info on if Milwaukee ever had any other cabaret acts, or when the cabaret itself was removed.
