##History##
West Palm Beach opened on December 18th, 1990 with one of three (Excluding Corporate) Prototype Road Stages (The others being [Jonesboro]({{< ref "wiki/Jonesboro, GA (335 Upper Riverdale Rd).md" >}}) & [Springfield, PA]({{< ref "wiki/Springfield, PA (381 Baltimore Pike).md" >}})) in a freestanding building located in the Pine Trail Shopping Center. This store was known to have no ceilings due to the previous tenant (Which was unknown).  In 1991/1992, the Road Stage Prototype was removed and replaced with a finalized one which also had no ceiling. By 1993, the store received another minor remodel which involved replacing some of the dor with 1990's decor.  

In December 2004, the store was closed due to hurricane damage. The store remained vacant for a few years until the building was demolished for a TD Bank in around 2007. As of June 2023, TD Bank still remains on the site.
