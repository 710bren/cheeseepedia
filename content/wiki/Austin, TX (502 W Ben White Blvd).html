<p><h2> Stages </h2></p>

<p>Around 1991/1992, this location underwent <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Concept Unification" >}}">Concept Unification</a>, converting the stage into a Munch's Make-Believe Band stage.

<p>On May 12th, 2013, after this store's closure, all 5 of the main bots were sent to the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/San Antonio, TX (6874 Ingram Rd)" >}}">San Antonio, TX (6874 Ingram Rd)</a> location before the stage was replaced with a Circle of Lights stage in 2014.</p>
