**_Dr. Juke**_ was a prototype [Show Selector]({{< ref "wiki/Show Selector.md" >}}) concept created by _Creative Engineering_ in 1983 that tested the use of showtapes on LaserDisc, and a touchscreen video interface.

The concept would implement two major changes to a _Rock-afire Explosion_ stage; It would provide a video touchscreen device in front of the stage as an upgraded Show Selector, and it would replace the [CEI 4-Track Reel]({{< ref "wiki/CEI 4-Track Reel.md" >}}) showtape format and tape deck with a LaserDisc player.

## Development ##
Only one LaserDisc was produced for the format (the [Dr. Juke Test Tape]({{< ref "wiki/Dr Juke Test Tape.md" >}}), as made by _Pioneer_). Presumably, software for Dr. Juke was created, as the animated segments allude to some understanding of how they would be animated beforehand. It is unclear if any prototype units were fully assembled, or if they remained as barebones concepts.

## Cancellation ##
Prototyping did not go any further than the first tape, and no [Dr. Juke]({{< ref "wiki/Dr Juke.md" >}}) units were produced for _Showbiz Pizza Place_; Additionally, CEI did not use the [CEI LaserDisc]({{< ref "wiki/CEI LaserDisc.md" >}}) format for any future content. CEI alludes to _Showbiz Pizza Place Inc._ and its changing culture leading up to the merger with _Pizza Time Theatre_ being the culprit for the cancellation of the idea.
