**_Dr. Juke**_ was a prototype [[Show Selector]] concept created by _Creative Engineering_ in 1983 that tested the use of showtapes on Laserdisc and a touchscreen video interface.

The concept would do two major changes to a _Rock-afire Explosion_ stage: Provide a video touchscreen device in front of the stage as an upgraded Show Selector, and replace the [[CEI 4-Track Reel]] showtape format and tape deck with a Laserdisc player.

##  Development ## 
Only one Laserdisc was produced for the format, the [[Dr. Juke Test Tape]], being made by _Pioneer._ Assumedly Dr. Juke software was created too, as the animated segments allude to some understanding of how they would be animated beforehand. It is unclear if any prototype units were fully assembled, or if they stayed as bare concepts.

##  Cancellation ## 
Prototyping didn't go any farther than the first tape, and no [[Dr. Juke]] units were produced for _Showbiz Pizza Place_, alongside CEI not using the [[CEI Laserdisc]] format for any future content. CEI alludes to _Showbiz Pizza Place Inc._ and its changing culture leading up to the merger with _Pizza Time Theatre_ being the culprit for the cancellation of the idea.
