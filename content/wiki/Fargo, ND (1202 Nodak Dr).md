**_1202 Nodak Dr**_ was a _Chuck E. Cheese’s_ that opened on February 8, 1984 as a franchised _ShowBiz Pizza Place_ with a [Rock afire Explosion]({{< ref "wiki/Rock afire Explosion.md" >}}).
##Stages##
Orem opened with the Rock afire Explosion in 1984. Unfortunately, there are no photos or videos to exist of Orem with the Rock afire, or as a ShowBiz in general. 

In the 1990s, Fargo received [Concept Unification]({{< ref "wiki/Concept Unification.md" >}}), converting the Rock afire into Munch’s Make Believe Band.
