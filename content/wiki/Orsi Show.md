**_Orsi Show**_ was a custom Italian [Hard Luck Bears]({{< ref "wiki/Hard Luck Bears.md" >}}) showtape for the _[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italia_in_miniatura Italia in Minitura]_ leisure park.

The tape was produced a year into the show's debut at the park, which originally used the English showtape. This would last throughout the show's lifetime, which would end in late 1993.<ref>https://www.parksmania.it/2015/06/16/italia-in-miniatura-il-video-storico-1993-di-orsi-show/</ref>
