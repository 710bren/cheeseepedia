**_Orsi Show**_ was a custom Italian [[Hard Luck Bears]] showtape for the _[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italia_in_miniatura Italia in Minitura]_ leisure park.

The tape was produced a year into the show's debut at the park, which originally used the English showtape. This would last throughout the show's lifetime, which would end in late 1993.<ref>https://www.parksmania.it/2015/06/16/italia-in-miniatura-il-video-storico-1993-di-orsi-show/</ref>

##  Summary ## 
The characters in the tape make reference to their stay at the park, and begin to introduce themselves, each demonstrating their instrument.
