## History ##
Independence opened in May 2012 (day unknown) as the relocation of the old store. It has the 2010 update of the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative, which included multiple things, like [Skytubes]({{< ref "wiki/Skytubes.md" >}}) and the Beta itself. Not much has changed, except the removal of Skytubes, and is still open to this day.
