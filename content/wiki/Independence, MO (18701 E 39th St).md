<b><i>18701 E 39th St</b></i> is a <i>Chuck E. Cheese's</i> that opened on May 2012 (day unknown) and is still open today with a Studio C 2000 (Studio C Beta, 16m). 

This was the relocation of [Independence, MO (4039 S Noland Rd)]({{< ref "wiki/Independence, MO (4039 S Noland Rd).md" >}}), which opened on October 14, 1980 as a Showbiz Pizza, and closed in May 2012 (day unknown) with a [3-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/Concept Unification Stage.md" >}}).

<h2> Stage </h2>
Independence has a Studio C 2000 (Studio C Beta, 16m). Starting with this store, the Beta was mixed with elements of the Small-Town Studio C (Studio C Cappa). The stage remains there today, with minor modifications.

<h2> History </h2>
Independence opened in May 2012 (day unknown) as the relocation of the old store. It has the 2010 update of the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative, which included multiple things, like [Skytubes]({{< ref "wiki/Skytubes.md" >}}) and the Beta itself. Not much has changed, except the removal of Skytubes, and is still open to this day.
