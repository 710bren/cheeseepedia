<b><i>Jungle Jim's Dolli</b></i> is a retrofit of [Dolli Dimples (Cabaret)]({{< ref "wiki/Dolli Dimples (Cabaret).md" >}}) at <i>Jungle Jim's International Market</i> in Cincinnati, Ohio. (5440 Dixie Hwy, Fairfield, OH 45014)

Dolli was first installed in 1988 and removed in 2000 

<h2>History</h2>
Dolli originally came from the [Cincinnati, OH (11400 Princeton Pike)]({{< ref "wiki/Cincinnati, OH (11400 Princeton Pike).md" >}}) Pizza Time Theatre and was bought by Jungle Jim's in Fall 1984. Dolli was first installed in 1988 being originally located next to checkout lanes (now exit doors for the 'Giraffe Parking'). Her stage was designed to look like she sat inside of a tree trunk with two palm trees positioned to the left and right of her with leaves covering the top. The backdrop was silver, yellow and orange streamers. Cosmetically Dolli had not been changed yet from when she was installed at PTT.  

In 2000 with the restructuring of the store the original exit was relocated with the new exit re-routed to where Dolli was. Dolli was then removed and used for parts on [Elvis]({{< ref "wiki/Elvis (The King Retrofit).md" >}}). As of today, any traces of Dolli at Jungle Jim's have been removed  

<h2>Lost Media & Unknown information.</h2>
With how few photos/footage exists of Dolli it is currently unknown what she performed, the only evidence she worked is from 'The Jungle Jim Story' which features footage from 1991 of Dolli. Showing that she was at least aired up.<ref>https://youtu.be/wXQxEUeOkok?t=445</ref>
