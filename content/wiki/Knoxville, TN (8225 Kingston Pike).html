<h2> History </h2>

<h2>= Opening and 1990's Remodel (1997-2006) </h2>=
Knoxville opened as a freestanding location on March 23rd, 1998, after the closure of the [[Knoxville, TN (7522 Kingston Pike)|7522 Kingston Pike]] location (Which closed months earlier) with one of the last new 1-Stages, with Mentor, Ohio being the last new 1-Stage store to open.

This also featured the removal of 90's elements such as the Showroom Walls, Dim Lighting, & Record Posters only keeping the Beverages Sign from opening. Chuck's Tuxedo would be replaced in around 2008-2010 for the Avenger Outfit. Then in September 2013, Chuck's cap would be removed to reflect his Rockstar redesign. Then in 2016, he would receive a new mask. The store would remain this way until the 2.0 Remodel.
