Cheese_ that opened on September 15, 1982 as a corporate _ShowBiz Pizza Place_ with a [https://chuckepedia.com/wiki/Classic_Stage Rock-Afire Explosion].

##History##
Westmoreland (Redbird) opened its doors on September 15th, 1982 with a Rock-afire Explosion show. It was originally and currently a corporate-owned store. Like many other ShowBiz Pizza locations, it had a typical SPP layout seen in many other stores across the United States and would eventually receive the 1988 remodel years after it would open. Although some documentation exists back in the ShowBiz days, it can be determined that Westmoreland (Redbird) was one of several locations to receive an Uncle Klunk show package (and a Santa Claus retrofit package as well) sometime after opening. Like many ShowBiz locations in the late 1980s, Westmoreland (Redbird) received the Showbiz Pizza Campground upgrade.

In around 1991, Westmoreland (Redbird) received Concept Unification which converted the show to Munch's Make Believe Band. In around the Mid-Late 1990's, Westmoreland (Redbird) received either [https://chuckepedia.com/wiki/Phase_1_(1994) Phase 1] or [https://chuckepedia.com/wiki/Phase_2_(1997) Phase 2] remodel which removed some early 90's decor, added new decor, a new exterior, and SkyTubes. Westmoreland (Redbird) remained this way until sometime in 2006-2007 when they received the 2005 Remodel which involved removing the Showroom Walls, balcony Seating, received a new exterior, an expansion of the store, and also removing some older 90's decor. On August 8th 2022, Westmoreland (Redbird) started their 2.0 remodel and later on in the month, they removed the 3-Stage for the Dance Floor. They were formerly the last 3-Stage in Texas. As of January 2023, they still have the 2.0 remodel and the Dance Floor.
