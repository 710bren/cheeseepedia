**_Pineville, NC (10400 Cadillac St)**_ was a _Celebration Station_ that opened around May 1991 with a  show, closing by June 3rd, 2005. The Pineville Celebration Station, along with the [Houston, TX (6767 Southwest Fwy)]({{< ref "wiki/Houston, TX (6767 Southwest Fwy).md" >}}), [Houston, TX (180 W Rankin Rd)]({{< ref "wiki/Houston, TX (180 W Rankin Rd).md" >}}), and [Knoxville, TN (400 N Peters Rd)]({{< ref "wiki/Knoxville, TN (400 N Peters Rd).md" >}}) locations were sold off by Whiteco and rebranded as _Zuma Fun Center_ in June 2005.

## Stages ##
Despite being the first location to open with a Sally Industries Daniel and the Dixie Diggers Trio with Jethro P. Hogg, Pineville's show was actually the second set built. The first DATDD Trio + Jethro set for Celebration Station was built for the [Oklahoma City, OK (509 Westline Dr)]({{< ref "wiki/Oklahoma City, OK (509 Westline Dr).md" >}}) location, but didn't premiere until June 28th, 1991. As these two sets of shows were the earliest built, the Dixie Diggers backdrops were detailed and colored differently to later locations. Daniel and Scratchmo retained their dark-shaded mask paints common to the 80's Quintet shows, though Scratchmo was later given a tan mask paint by the 2000's, resembling the later 90's coloring of Scratchmo's face that has since been adopted by Sally to this day. Daniel's dark-shaded mask was left unchanged during the show's entire lifespan.

## Animatronics ##
As Zuma Fun Center trashed their animatronics by 2010-2011, the exact whereabouts of each individual character are unknown. However, disassembled parts of Pineville's animatronics and equipment (including the head mechanism of Daniel T. Bones) were listed on eBay. It can be implied that upon removal, the animatronics were 'destroyed,' with only a handful of pieces salvaged by former Zuma staff. Additional animatronic parts for Pineville were kept in a fishing tackle box long past the show removal, which has since been given to a private collector prior to the building's demolition in 2022.
