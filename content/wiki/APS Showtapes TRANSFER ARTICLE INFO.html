[Animation Programming System]({{< ref "wiki/Animation Programming System.html" >}}) showtapes are the raw files used in programming Chuck E. Cheese showtapes. Each file represents a single segment of the tape, or a single live show. Versions of APS are used to this day, though Studio C HD shows have their lights performed in VenueMagic.

<h2> Discovery </h2>
The current list of APS files is from a pack of 5 floppy cases from CEC Corporate, each containing a selection of APS showtapes. More info on these cases can be found on the [1990-1992 APS Floppy Cases]({{< ref "wiki/1990-1992 APS Floppy Cases.html" >}}) page.

<h2> APS List </h2>
APS files for showtapes exist for all shows starting sometime in 1990, all the way to present day. This list narrows the shows provided to just the ones that have their APS files public.
