<b><i>15405 Park Ave</b></i> was a Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre that opened on October 5, 1982 with a [[Cyberamics Balcony Stage|Balcony Stage]] and closed in June 1993 (day unknown) with [Chuck E.'s House Facade]({{< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House Facade.html" >}}). Not much is known about this location, other than a few photos, but videos can be hard to find. It later became Buzz-E's Pizza Time Circus not long after, closing at an unknown date.

This is not to be confused with [Victorville, CA (12790 Amargosa Rd)]({{< ref "wiki/Victorville, CA (12790 Amargosa Rd).html" >}}), which opened on December 14, 1999 with a Studio C Alpha, and is still open today with the 2.0 remodel.

<h2> Stages</h2>

Later in 1989/1990, they received [Chuck E.'s House Facade]({{< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House Facade.html" >}}), or the C-Stage. After the June 1993 closure, it became Buzz-E's Pizza Time Circus, which retrofitted the C-Stage, which lasted until the mid-late 90s, when they closed.

<h2>History</h2>
Victorville opened on October 5, 1982 with a Balcony Stage. Not much is known about this location, other than a few photos, including an exterior photo as seen above. Their first guest star was likely Madame Oink, and was replaced with Helen Henny in late 1983. Victorville then received the 1988 remodel in 1989/1990 involving removing all PTT decor for new decor, changing the name to Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza, added checkers inside and outside the store, updated the road sign, and retrofitted the Balcony Stage to Chuck E.'s House Facade. In June 1993, Victorville shut its doors for unknown reasons, but likely leasing issues. Later in 1993, they became Buzz-E's Pizza Time Circus, which removed all mentions of CEC. It closed at an unknown date, and later became a furniture store, and then a Planned Parenthood, the latter is still on the space.
