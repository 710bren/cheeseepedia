The **Cyberamic 3-Stage** is a stage format found at the [\2](\1) Chuck E. Cheese's location. Lynnwood had a normal 3-Stage, but replaced the CEI bots with Cyberamics from the Spokane, Washington store in 2000, since Spokane relocated. Springfield, Massachusetts also installed this stage in late 2017, but Springfield permanently closed during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.
