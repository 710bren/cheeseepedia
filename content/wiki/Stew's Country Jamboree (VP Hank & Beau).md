**_Stew's Country Jamboree**_ is an animatronic show that has been produced by VP Animations, LLC for Stew Leonard's since 2016. The characters and soundtrack originate from Sally Industries' _[The Hank and Beau Show]({{< ref "wiki/The Hank and Beau Show.md" >}})_, which was previously installed in two of the chain's locations in the mid-1980's and 1991, respectively. As of 2024, four sets of _Stew's Country Jamboree_ have been constructed by VP and operate at only four of the chain's seven stores.

## Historical Background ##
When Stew Leonard's first implemented animatronics in their initial  from Sally Industries in Jacksonville, Florida.<ref>https://youtu.be/DqUgmo5Gl_4?si=EJVgwS8sJIUN9VA1&t=2486</ref> Another _Hank and Beau_ was purchased for and installed at the [Danbury, CT (99 Federal Rd)]({{< ref "wiki/Danbury, CT (99 Federal Rd).md" >}}) store in 1991. Since then, Stew Leonard's did not continue to purchase _Hank and Beau_ shows from Sally. It is currently unknown if Sally continued to provide maintenance services for the Norwalk and Danbury shows up through the 2010's. It should also be noted that the Danbury _Hank and Beau_ was relocated to [Yonkers, NY (1 Stew Leonard Dr)]({{< ref "wiki/Yonkers, NY (1 Stew Leonard Dr).md" >}}) in August 2013.

As the  for the sole Tom Leonard's location in Richmond, VA (a bootleg of _Hank and Beau_ with similar characters and a custom soundtrack produced for Stew Sr.'s second son, Tom). The end result was _Stew's Country Jamboree_, which premiered on January 20th, 2016 with the opening of Farmingdale's Stew Leonard's.<ref>https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/farm-fresh-food-grocer-stew-leonards-opens-in-farmingdale-ny-300207159.html</ref>

Following the 2022-2024 remodel process of the original Norwalk location, the Sally _Hank and Beau_ were 'refurbished' by VP in the late summer months of 2022. Unlike a previous refurbishment for the Danbury/Yonkers show (which mostly retained the existing Sally cosmetics), the decision was made to replace worn cosmetic pieces with those from the _Stew's Country Jamboree_ iteration. With Col. Beau in particular, his snout, mouth, ears, and hands were sourced from VP's iteration of the character and thus became a bizarre hybrid between the two versions. Hank Winter was mainly unaffected appearance-wise (as he was drastically changed as far back as 2013). However, Hank was given a new plaid shirt from the VP iteration of the character.<ref>https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cj_PAZrjZs9/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA##</ref>

## Differences with Sally's _Hank and Beau_ ##
The _Stew's Country Jamboree_ iterations of _Hank and Beau_ have similarities to the original Sally show. However, there are radical differences in appearances and mechanics in comparison to Sally's version, which include but are not limited to:

* Col. Beau given a white, cowboy-like hat instead of a confederate soldier hat (or navy admiral hat) on Sally's Col. Beau.
* Col. Beau's pupils on his eyes are enlarged significantly, appearing almost as if he has no whites on his eyes.
* Col. Beau's ears are the same fur color as the rest of his head, instead of a darker grey, and are longer, low-hanging ears on VP's design.
* Col. Beau's legs on VP's animatronic are straight and close together, instead of outward and bent on Sally's animatronic.
* Hank Winter is given overalls and a plaid shirt, in contrast to Sally's standard blue shirt with red shoulder fabric + yellow fringe and navy blue jeans. 
** Hank's yellow scarf is a design element carried over from a cosmetic addition made to the two original Sally Hank Winters by Stew Leonard's.<ref>https://youtu.be/hySlmeq7ju4?si=LC1G3q8Q9dojTCcR&t=350</ref>
* The control system and soundtrack is completely digitized, whereas the two original _Hank and Beau_ sets at Stew Leonard's (Norwalk and Danbury/Yonkers) operated through [Sally's Animation Control System (ACS)]({{< ref "wiki/Sally's Animation Control System (ACS).md" >}}), using audio cassettes for an audio source and programming data.
