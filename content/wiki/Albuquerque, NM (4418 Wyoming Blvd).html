It is located in the Montgomery Crossing shopping center. It is also the only PTT in the state of New Mexico. Until the opening of the Albuquerque, NM (10510 Coors Blvd)|Coors Blvd location which ended up becoming the state's first 2.0 store.
<h2>History</h2>
Albuquerque (Wyoming) opened its doors in October 1981 with a Balcony Stage show and was originally a franchised-owned store. Unfortunately, very little documentation exists back in the Pizza Time Theatre era. Like many other Pizza Time Theatre locations, it had the typical PTT layout seen in many other stores across the United States. In the Late 80's, they removed the Balcony Stage for the Chuck E.'s House Facade stage. In 1989/1990, Albuquerque (Wyoming) received the 1988 remodel and received a new exterior, removed all PTT decor for newer decor, and an exterior change. The oldest known footage of the store was a tape for employee's that summited footage of various live performances (The store was featured alongside <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Wilmington, NC (4389 Oleander Dr)" >}}">Wilmington, NC</a>, <a href="{{< ref "wiki/San Jose, CA (2445 Fontaine Rd)" >}}">San Jose, CA (2445 Fontaine Rd)</a>, <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Mesa, AZ (856 S Alma School Rd)" >}}">Mesa, AZ (856 S Alma School Rd)</a>, <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Dothan, AL (3400 Ross Clark Circle)" >}}">Dothan</a>, <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Harrisburg, PA (3883 Union Deposit Rd)" >}}">Harrisburg</a>, <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Erie, PA (7200 Peach St)" >}}">Erie</a>, <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Tallahassee, FL (2810 Sharer Rd)" >}}">Tallahassee</a>, <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Merced, CA (721 W Olive Ave)" >}}">Merced</a>, & <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Tracy, CA (775 W Clover Rd)" >}}">Tracy</a>) which featured the store's Chuck E.'s House Facade. In around 1993/1994, the Chuck E.'s House Facade was converted into a 2-Stage which involved it being relocated to the back wall. Around the Late 90's, Albuquerque (Wyoming) received another remodel which removed some early 90's decor and added new decor, SkyTubes and also an exterior change. On August 16th, 1999, the location was sold to the corporate. Albuquerque (Wyoming) remained this way until sometime in 2007-2008 when they received the 2005 Update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative which involved removing the Showroom Walls, Balcony Seating, received a major exterior change, and also removing some older 90's decor. In 2017, the exterior received a paint job. Albuquerque (Wyoming) would remain like this until September 2022 when they received 2.0 and removed the 2-Stage for a 2021 Model Dance Floor and Video Wall. As of January 2023, they still have the 2.0 Remodel and the 2021 Model Dance Floor.
