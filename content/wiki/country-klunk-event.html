<h3>Unconfirmed Stores</h3>
Due to evidence that {{< wiki-link "Chicago, IL (5030 S Kedzie Ave)" >}} installed their sign mech for {{< wiki-link "Country Klunk" >}} in 1985, a store that wasn't open until November 1, 1984, stores that have sign mechs installed do not confirm whether they had received Klunk in 1983, or at a later time. These stores are currently unconfirmed due to this:<ul><li>{{< wiki-link "Dallas, TX (7110 S Westmoreland Rd)" >}}</li><li>{{< wiki-link "Houston, TX (5535 Weslayan St)" >}}</li></ul>
Two stores had some sort of Klunk part discovered at their location. Springfield with Klunk valves, and Davenport with a Klunk arm. This confirms Klunk was present at their store at some point, but it is unknown which event(s) he was used in. Davenport does mention potentially receiving a Klunk for 1983 however.<ref name=':0'>https://www.newspapers.com/image/665684553/?clipping_id=55395460&fcfToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJmcmVlLXZpZXctaWQiOjY2NTY4NDU1MywiaWF0IjoxNjk2OTcwNDk0LCJleHAiOjE2OTcwNTY4OTR9.sClG1OZrf2KnRIxRDXP7BAdtVpv1p4YKdgIgIRQHA4Q</ref><ul><li>{{< wiki-link "Springfield, OH (2345 Valley Loop Rd)" >}}<sup>(3)</sup></li><li>{{< wiki-link "Davenport, IA (903 E Kimberly Rd)" >}}<sup>(4)</sup><sup>(0)</sup></li></ul>
