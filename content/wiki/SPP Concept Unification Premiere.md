The <b><i>SPP Concept Unification Premiere Show</b></i> was an exclusive showtape used to premiere all new 3-Stage shows, which made its first debut on June 21, 1990, and lasted across stores until 1993. 
<h2>Concept Unification</h2>
The tape came with the entire [Concept Unification]({{< ref "wiki/Concept Unification.md" >}}) package, which included a special backup [SPP Concept Unification Emergency Backup Tape]({{< ref "wiki/SPP Concept Unification Emergency Backup Tape.md" >}}), the last Rock-afire showtape [SPP Rolfe & Earl/Bday Wave]({{< ref "wiki/SPP Rolfe & EarlBday Wave.md" >}}) and its own backup tape being SPP Rolfe & Earl Emergency Backup Tape, along with other material.

During the Concept Unification conversion process, the Rolfe & Earl stage would be kept up while the store was open, so the character could perform alongside this tape. A special Rolfe & Earl birthday was included for any potential birthday parties while the other stages was still under construction. The Rolfe & Earl stage would then be dismantled and turn into Chuck E.'s stage overnight, allowing Concept Unification Premiere to be ready the next morning.

Concept Unification Premiere was the only full showtape to be agnostic from any set premiere dates. Stores would always play this as their first 3-Stage tape, before switching to whatever the current showtape was. This lasted from 1990 to 1993 throughout the Concept Unification process.

<h2>Trivia</h2>
*The intermission music would be recycled for [CEC September 1990 Show]({{< ref "wiki/CEC September 1990 Show.md" >}}), and would also be used for its counterpart [SPP Best Of 1 Kids/Friends]({{< ref "wiki/SPP Best Of 1 KidsFriends.md" >}}) (Without the last two songs).
*The Dallas (Montfort Dr.), Texas Showbiz was the first location to receive this show in 1989.
*Because of this show being created before a proper Helen Henny walkaround, a modified latex mask of her was put on top of an existing Mitzi Mozzarella head frame.
