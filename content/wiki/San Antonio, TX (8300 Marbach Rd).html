<h2>History</h2>
Unfortunately, there is no documentation on this store other than select advertisements. The location closed in February 1984 for reasons unknown, maybe for underperforming or competition from other San Antonio stores. It was later vacated and sold to many other businesses, and as of today, it is now El Bucanero, a Mexican restaurant.
