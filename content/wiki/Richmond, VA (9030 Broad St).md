**_9030 Broad St**_, also known as **_Henrico**_, is a _Chuck E. Cheese's_ that opened on March 4, 1999 and is still open today with a [[Studio C Alpha]]. 

This is not to be confused with [[Richmond, VA (10430 Midlothian Turnpike)]], which opened on May 1, 1990 and is still open today with the 2.0 remodel, and is in the city limits of **_Bon Air**_.

##  History ## 
Henrico opened on March 4, 1999 with a [\2](\1) remodel. Barely any information on Henrico exists at this time.

In 2008/2009, Henrico received the 2005 update to the [[2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative]], which involved removing all 90s decor, showroom walls, balcony seating, added purple walls, and changed the exterior. As of August 2023, Henrico remains operational.
