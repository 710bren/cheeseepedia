## Stages ##
Originally when the store opened, they had a 1-Stage, which also had a turntable, though it would be removed later on. Currently as of October 2022, they still have the 1-Stage, where Chuck E. wears his Avenger outfit with his hat, the animatronics are also in poor condition, and there is also no Wink. Lo Barnechea is one of two 1-Stages outside the United States, with , which is also in Chile, being the other.
