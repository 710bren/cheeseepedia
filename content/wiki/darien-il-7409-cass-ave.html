<b><i>7409 Cass Ave, Store #685</b></i> is a Chuck E. Cheese's located in Darien, Illinois.
This location opened as a ShowBiz Pizza Place on February 24, 1981, and is still open today with the 2.0 remodel.
<h2>Stages</h2>
Darien opened with The Rock-afire Explosion. Their original show was made in October 1980, however, their show was replaced in 1985 with <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Benton Harbor, MI (1956 Pipestone Rd)" >}}">Benton Harbor, MI</a>'s show, an April 1982 show.
In the late 80s the store would receive the Showbiz Pizza Campground retrofit before undergoing <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Concept Unification" >}}">Concept Unification</a> in November 1991.
Throughout the 1990s and the 2000s, Darien's show was in the average condition for a 3-Stage at the time. However, Darien was in a state of disrepair from around 2009-2011. It was repaired substantially in 2012, and was in pretty good condition, until 2015 when most movements stopped working, and Pasqually notoriously only had about three functional movements during this period.
In late 2019, major repairs on the stage began. Chuck E., Munch, and Jasper were almost fully functional, with Helen and Pasqually slowly improving. But, during this time, the compressor that ran the show began to have major issues. It started breaking down often, and eventually by January 2020, did not work at all.
In January 2020 the show received a Studio C compressor, which could only operate Chuck E. This would cause the rest of the show to be completely unfunctional aside from the lighting.
In June 2020, it was decided by the district managers that Darien would be receiving the Studio C show from the Joliet, IL which remodeled earlier that year. On June 30th, 2020, the center stage characters and backdrops were removed. The same day, Joliet's animatronic and backdrops were installed on the stage. By July 6th, 2020, the new stage was functional. Later that month, curtains were put up on stage left and right, and Chuck E. and Pasqually were removed from their stages.
The show would be heavily documented by a cast member that went by the online alias 'showbizpizzafan'. He would also go on to dub the show 'Studio 3' in the comments of one of the first reveals of the stage.<sup>(1)</sup>
In June 2023, the CU Beta 16m was removed for the 2021 Dance Floor and Video Wall.

Darien underwent the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative in 2008 which involved removing the showroom walls, balcony seating, replacing lighting, and replacing the artwork.
Around 2014, Darien replaced their 90s exterior signage with 2013 signage. Between June 30, 2020, and July 6, 2020, they removed the 3-Stage for the CU 2000 16M|CU Beta 16m.
