{{Generic|image=SPP Cherry Hill AD.jpg|desc=Advertisement for Cherry Hill's SPP when it was open.}}
**_Cherry Hill, NJ (1660 N Kings Hwy)**_ was a _ShowBiz Pizza Place_ that opened in January 1985 with a [\2](\1), and closed in 1986 for unknown reasons.

This location shouldn't be confused with the [[Cherry Hill, NJ (2100 Rt 38)]] location, which opened as a _Chuck E. Cheese's_ on August 25, 1992 with a [[2-Stage]], and is still open to this day with the [[CEC 2018 2.0 Remodel Program]].

Unfortunately, documentation on the Cherry Hill SPP store falls into extreme scarcity, and no photos or videos have been found as of 2023.

## History## 
Cherry Hill SPP opened in January 1985. It had a Rock-afire Explosion, and most likely had the standard store layout like all other SPP locations had. Sadly, very little information on Cherry Hill's Showbiz Pizza is extremely hard to find, so no videos or photos have resurfaced as of today. This location didn't last very long, as it would closed on an unknown date in 1986. After closure, the store most likely held an auction, and sold off everything.
