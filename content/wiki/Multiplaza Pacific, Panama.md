Multiplaza Pacific Mall, Panama City, Panama is a Chuck E Cheese’s that opened on early 2013 (date unknown) with a [[Circles of Light]] stage with a 16M animatronic. It is located on the third floor of Multiplaza Mall. {{Generic|image=Multiplaza Panama exterior.jpeg |desc=A picture of the exterior inside the mall.(PC: Rene M. in Foursquare)}}

## History##  
Because of their expansion in Latin America, Chuck E Cheese’s decided to open a location in Panama.

The store opened in 2013 to much fanfare, so much so that a second location opened in 2017.

## Exterior and Interior## 
This location is a very early version of the [\2](\1)  and the toddler playground from that remodel.

The store also has a checkered wall that is actually a window, looking to the road outside the mall.
