Multiplaza Pacific Mall, Panama City, Panama is a Chuck E Cheese’s that opened on early 2013 (date unknown) with a [Circles of Light]({{< ref "wiki/Circles of Light.md" >}}) stage with a 16M animatronic. It is located on the third floor of Multiplaza Mall. 

<h2>History</h2> 
Because of their expansion in Latin America, Chuck E Cheese’s decided to open a location in Panama.

The store opened in 2013 to much fanfare, so much so that a second location opened in 2017.

<h2>Exterior and Interior</h2>
This location is a very early version of the 2013 Update remodel, having a prototype of the International Mall Entrance, and many things that are not from the 2013 Update, including the “Kids” Posters from the [2005 Reconfiguration]({{< ref "wiki/CEC 2005 Remodel Program.md" >}})  and the toddler playground from that remodel.

The store also has a checkered wall that is actually a window, looking to the road outside the mall.
