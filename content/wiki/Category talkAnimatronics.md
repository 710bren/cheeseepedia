I recommend adding disambiguation pages to the characters. That way, on other parts of the wiki, if someone clicks a link to a character, it'll ask them to clarify whether they want the technical aspects of the animatronic or if they want to access the character focused page. Wikipedia does a similar thing. Example: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boat_(disambiguation). I believe this would help clear up confusion on the wiki. - Sponch man
