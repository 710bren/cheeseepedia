**Deptford, NJ (1500 Almonesson Rd)** is a Chuck E. Cheese’s location located in Deptford, New Jersey; in The Court at Deptford shopping center. This location opened on November 12, 1991. 

## Stages ##
This location opened up with a Road Stage and was converted to a 1-stage sometime in the mid-90s. The 1-stage is different than normal 1-stages as it has the 2-stage props. Munch’s hat and the Munch’s Make Believe Band sign were both removed in May 2015. The sign was replaced with a flatscreen TV. In January 2016, the usual lights on the star were replaced with LED strips. Chuck E. received the Rockstar jeans in October 2019 and the Rockstar shirt in February/March 2020.

## History ##
The store received the 2005 remodel package in 2007. In May 2014, The Court at Deptford shopping center was acquired by DLC Management and planned to redevelop the entire shopping center to give it a more modernized look. These renovations started in autumn 2015 and were completed the following summer.
