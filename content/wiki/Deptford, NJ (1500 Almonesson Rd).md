**_1500 Almonesson Rd, Store #481**_ is a Chuck E. Cheese’s location located in Deptford, New Jersey; in The Court at Deptford shopping center. This location opened on November 12, 1991, and is still open to this day with a dance floor + video wall. 

## Stages ##
This location opened up with a Road Stage and was converted to a 1-stage sometime in 1994-1995. The 1-stage was different than normal 1-stages as it has the 2-stage props. Munch’s hat and the Munch’s Make Believe Band sign were both removed in May 2015. The sign was replaced with a flatscreen TV. In January 2016, the usual lights on the star were replaced with LED strips. Chuck E. received the Rockstar jeans in October 2019 and the Rockstar shirt in February/March 2020.

## History ##
The store received the [2005 remodel package]({{< ref "wiki/CEC 2005 Remodel Program.md" >}}) around mid-May of 2007. In May 2014, The Court at Deptford shopping center was acquired by DLC Management and planned to redevelop the entire shopping center to give it a more modernized look. These renovations started in autumn 2015 and were completed the following summer. In November 2022, Deptford started their 2.0 Remodel which will involve the removal of the store's 1-Stage which was finally removed on December 14th, 2022. Deptford's Grand Reopening was on February 22nd, 2023.
