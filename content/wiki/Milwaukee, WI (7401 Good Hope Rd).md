## History ##
Milwaukee (Good Hope Rd) opened on June 17th, 1981 as the first Showbiz Pizza Place in Wisconsin as a Franchised store in the space that once housed a Kmart Foods Grocery Store. Milwaukee (Good Hope Rd) originally featured the Rock-afire Explosion, as all other Showbiz locations did. they would have it for a few years, until 1988, when it was removed and sent to [Raleigh]({{< ref "wiki/Raleigh, NC (3501-131 Capital Blvd).md" >}}) for the opening on their location in June (It would then undergo Concept Unification around 3 years later). It would then be replaced with [Chuck E.'s House]({{< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House.md" >}}) when they got the 1986 SPT Remodel Program, this was one of three Showbiz Pizza stores to get this stage, the other two being [White Settlement]({{< ref "wiki/White Settlement, TX (7750 Scott St).md" >}}) (Which got it after they reopened) and [Citrus Heights]({{< ref "wiki/Citrus Heights, CA (6251 Sunrise Blvd).md" >}}). They would then have it until sometime in 1994 when they received the 1994 SPT Repositioning / Remodel Program which involved the conversion of [Chuck E.'s House]({{< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House.md" >}}) to a 1-Stage, they then would remain this way until the store was permanently closed a year later in 1995 for unknown reasons. The whole building, including the neighboring Kmart would then be demolished for a Home Depot for 2005, which closed in 2008. The site is now a Pick 'n Save. As of May 2023, Pick 'n Save is still in the building.
