<h2> History </h2>
Independence opened in May 2012 (day unknown) as the relocation of the old store. It has the 2010 update of the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative, which included multiple things, like [Skytubes]({{< ref "wiki/Skytubes.html" >}}) and the Beta itself. Much has changed as now the store is now a 2.0 store.
