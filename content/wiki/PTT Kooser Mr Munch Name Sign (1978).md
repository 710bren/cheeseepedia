The Mr. Munch Nameplate was used at the second [Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre located on 1371 Kooser Road]({{< ref "wiki/San Jose, CA (1371 Kooser Rd).md" >}}) in San Jose, California; placed under the newly introduced Kooser Mr. Munch (Animatronic) (Mr. Munch animatronic) where it was used to identify the animatronic.

## Production ##
Although we do not have much specific information on when the name tag was produced, we can theorize it was produced between October 1978 to November 1978 alongside the other name tags in a short timespan due to the simplicity of their design.

## Usage/Releases ##
The only usage of this fixture was at the 1371 Kooser Road store, where it was in use from December 1978 to May 1980, where it would ultimately be shipped to Sunnyvale or put in one of many storage rooms in the 20,000 square foot pizza parlor. 


One other known nametag is known from the time period, most likely put together in haste; it features 'MR. MUNCH' on a tan, rounded piece of paper with a black thin border surrounding the text, opposed to the more professionally made fixture seen in store.

## Design ##
Like all other Kooser nameplates, Mr. Munch's nameplate uses a brown base with the yellow text 'MR. MUNCH' in the standard Pizza Time Theatre font at the time, also enclosed in a similar thin border to all other nameplates.
