The <b><i>Kooser Mr. Munch Nameplate</b></i> was only used at the second Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre located on [1371 Kooser Road]({{< ref "wiki/San Jose, CA (1371 Kooser Rd).md" >}}) located in the Blossom Hill Shopping Center in San Jose, California; where it was placed below the newly introduced Kooser Mr. Munch (Animatronic) (Mr. Munch) animatronic from as early as November 1978, to May, 1980.

<h2> Production </h2>
Production on the earlier Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre signage is scarce, however it can be assumed Fantasy Forest Manufacturing produced these nameplates from October through November 1978 alongside the production of the Kooser Portrait Show. However, if production on the Kooser nameplates, including Mr. Munch's nameplate was not headed by Fantasy Forest, we can assume it was produced by either Pizza Time Theatre Incorporated, or by a contracting company. 


Once production on the nameplates were completed, it is most likely that they were shipped out together in preparation for the opening of the 1371 Kooser Road Store, which would be the world's largest pizza parlor at 20,000 square feet. <ref>ptt_78kooser.pdf (showbizpizza.com)</ref>

<h2> Usage </h2>
The only usage of the Kooser Mr. Munch nameplate was at the 1371 Kooser Road store, where it was placed on Mr. Munch's portrait from as early as November 1978, to May, 1980.<ref>https://www.showbizpizza.com/info/documents/ptt/ptt_pizzatimes-1980.pdf</ref> After the nameplate was retired alongside the Kooser Portrait Show, there could have been several outcomes to the nameplate, those being:  

* <b>A.</b> <i>The nameplate was placed in one of several storage rooms at the 1371 Kooser Road location and thrown out.</i>
* <b>B.</b> <i>The nameplate was placed in one of several storage rooms at the 1371 Kooser Road location and intentionally destroyed.</i>
* <b>C.</b> <i>The nameplate was placed in one of several storage rooms at the 1371 Kooser Road location and auctioned off.</i>
* <b>D.</b> <i>The nameplate was sent to the 1213 Innsbruck Drive corporate office in Sunnyvale, California, alongside the Kooser Portrait Animatronics.</i>
