##Trivia:##

* This is the first domestic show to use the Evergreen format in which the same generic show would run in between seasonal and promotional events.
* 'Chuck E.'s Middle Name' and 'Crochet All Day' is originally from Chuck E. Cheese's Show 2 2021 (Show 2 2021), 'Dream Big' is originally from Chuck E. Cheese's Show 5 2016 (Show 5 2016), 'Play All You Can Play' is originally from Chuck E. Cheese's Show 3 2019 (Show 3 2019), 'Jasper's Country Classic' is originally from Chuck E. Cheese's Show 3 2018 (Show 3 2018), 'Keep Drummin_ is originally from Chuck E. Cheese's Show 1 2016 (Show 1 2016), 'Barbara the Barnyard Barber' and 'El Rey Guitarrista' are originally from Chuck E. Cheese's Show 2 2020 (Show 2 2020).
* The Studio C Programming for Keep Drummin' was redone but only for the Animatronic. The programming was changed & added the gemini for Pasqually's Drumo solo all other lighting was kept the same from Chuck E. Cheese's Show 1 2016 (Show 1 2016).

*Several parts of this show are reused from Chuck E. Cheese's Show 2 2021 (Show 2 2021) Such as the Skits 'Jasper's Country Classic', 'Crochet All Day', 'Chuck E.'s Middle Name' and 'El Rey Guitarrista' along with that three intermissions were reused from Chuck E. Cheese's Show 2 2021 (Show 2 2021) those being Danny “Tricycle”, Ants Ants Ants “Pinwheel” and No School Today “Marsupial”
*All Live show countdowns have been reduced from 7 minutes to 5 minutes.
*This was the last show to include Birthday Live at Home following its introduction in Chuck E. Cheese's Show 2 2020 (Show 2 2020). With the reintroduction of the Chuck E. Cheese walk-around in June 2021 after COVID-19 policies were loosened, stores began playing the recently reissued Birthday Star Spectacular again and the walk-around-less show became redundant. It would be removed from circulation beginning with Chuck E. Cheese Springtastic Show 2022 (Springtastic Show 2022) as would it when Evergreen Show 2022 was Chuck E. Cheese Evergreen Show 2022 (April Update) (reissued) in April.
