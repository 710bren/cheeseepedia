<p><b><i>321 Mary Esther Blvd, Store #2044,</b></i> often erroneously known as <b><i>Fort Walton</b></i>, was a franchised Showbiz Pizza Place/Chuck E. Cheese's that opened in 1983 (day and month unknown) and closed on January 9th, 2005, after 23 years in operation. It was standalone, with no shopping center near it. This store would have a unique exterior, roof painted pink (previously dark green), which would be kept until they closed. This store is notable, as it was one of the most outdated former Showbiz Pizza Place locations open at the time.</p>
<p><h2> History </h2></p>
<p><h3> Showbiz Pizza Era (1983-Early 1990s) </h3></p>
<p>This store would host it's grand opening in 1983 as the 12th Showbiz Pizza Store in Florida, where the store would have the Rock-afire Explosion, featuring the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Classic Stage" >}}">Classic Stage</a>. Not much is known about Mary Esther as a Showbiz Pizza Place, but they likely had the same features that every Showbiz location had at the time. This would include many arcade games, wood paneling, and a play-place. No images or videos of the Showbiz era have surfaced.</p>
<p><h3> CEC Era (Early 1990s-2005)</h3></p>
<p>Sometime in the early 1990s, likely 1991 or 1992, Mary Esther would remodel to a Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza, which involved the removal of the Rock-afire Explosion, and the addition of the 3-Stage. The exterior sign was replaced. This remodel involved also adding new games, redoing the interior, and getting new fixtures. It is unknown if they would ever receive the Phase 2 (1997|Phase 2, or <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Phase 3 (2000)" >}}">Phase 3</a> game packages during this store's lifetime.</p>
<p>Sometime in the late 1990s-early 2000s, this store would get a new exterior sign, the exterior being repainted for the 2nd and final time, and get the 1993 remodel, with the c-cap Coach Chuck sign. Nothing much would be changed, as until they closed, they would keep most of the 1988 remodel features. They would, also at an unknown date, get plastic cosmetics for the animatronics.</p>
<p>It is notable that despite remodeling, Mary Esther would leave many Showbiz Pizza features behind. This includes the old sign frame on the exterior and road sign, recycled for the new sign, a Pizza Time Theatre-era Chuck E. neon drink sign, coming from an unknown store, latex Mr. Munch cosmetics, the tuxedo on the Chuck E. animatronic, and the Showbiz Pizza restroom sign. many rare and obscure games were sent to Mary Esther, some of the games were, Laser Ghost, Pirate Ship, Sonic The Hedgehog Coin Game (which had sonic’s arms blue), and a huge ball crawl setup, would all be kept until closure.</p>
<p>On January 9th, 2005, this store would close permanently for unknown reasons. Many reasons could be responsible for this store closure, including how outdated it was, how it appeared unpopular, or lease disputes within the business. After the store's closure, the franchisee of the store, George Haber, would host an auction at the location on January 15th<sup>[1]</sup>, with the franchisee of <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Panama City, FL (4432 US-98)" >}}">the Panama City location</a> participating in the auction.<ref name=':0'>https://uwf-flvc.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/fulldisplay?docid=cdi_proquest_wirefeeds_461713177&context=PC&vid=01FALSC_UWF:UWF&lang=en&search_scope=MyInst_and_CI2&adaptor=Primo%20Central&tab=Everything&query=any,contains,Chuck%20E%20Cheese%20Mary%20Esther&pcAvailability=true</ref> The store would be vacant then after, with the bots and backdrops being sold to collectors.</p>
<p><h3>Post-CEC Era (2005-Present)</h3></p>
<p>After the store closed, it would remain vacant for a short period until it was finally demolished. The former plot of the location is now a parking lot for a seafood restaurant, which remains open to this day.</p>
