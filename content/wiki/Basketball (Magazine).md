The poster is held in a 20Â½ in. by 17 in. dark blue/red picture frame. The main photo of the poster depicts the Chuck Statue - Basketball (Shelf Item) which has Chuck E. Cheese in a Chicago Bulls uniform holding a basketball. On the left side of the poster there's quotes from critics. The last one is a reference to how Chuck E Cheese has passed Magic Johnson & Michael Jordan on Basketball fame.
