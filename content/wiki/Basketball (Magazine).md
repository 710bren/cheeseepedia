The **Basketball (Magazine)** was a poster created for Chuck E. Cheese's around 1994-1995 for the 1990s Major Remodel.

## Design ##
The poster is held in either a 20Â½' x 17', or 15' x 12' dark blue/red picture frame. The main photo of the poster depicts the Chuck Statue - Basketball (Shelf Item) which has Chuck E. Cheese in a Chicago Bulls uniform holding a basketball. On the left side of the poster there's quotes from critics. The last one is a reference to how Chuck E Cheese has passed Magic Johnson & Michael Jordan on Basketball fame.
