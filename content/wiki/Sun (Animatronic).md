The **Sun Animatronic** is an animatronic figure created by Creative Engineering Inc. for Showbiz Pizza Place locations from 1980-1983

It is a very simple figure, as its only movements are its raising from behind the backdrop, and opening its mouth. The Sun would later be used in the [Concept Unification Stage]({{< ref "wiki/Concept Unification Stage.md" >}}),aka, the 3-Stage, where it would be changed into Building, which is a building with eyes and a mouth.
