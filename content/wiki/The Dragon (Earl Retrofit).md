[\2](\1)
The Dragon, is a Earl retrofit made for Lumalusion at the Texas State Fair, the mechanism was taken off of a [\2](\1) (Presumably the same which was turned into [\2](\1) as well), the head tilt and arm twist movement cylinders were removed leaving only the mouth and eyebrow movements accessible.

To support the mechanism having missing cylinders, a wooden block was put around the arm twist, a wooden rod put at the head tilt down where the cylinder would once be and a metal bracket put from the bottom of the head to the top of where the arm would start (now the base of the mechanism) this was to ensure nothing would slip and move when unintended. (It is also possible that the eye positioning was spread more apart, however it is hard to tell with limited resources).

The cosmetics have a wire-frame base underneath to support the shape of the cosmetics, however due to limited resources it is hard to tell what the cosmetics were made of outside of this.
