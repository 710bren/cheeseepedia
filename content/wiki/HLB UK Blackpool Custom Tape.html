The <b><i>HLB UK Blackpool Custom Tape</b></i> was a custom showtape produced by and for Blackpool Pleasure Beach in Blackpool, Lancashire, England. 

<h2> Summary </h2>

* Grandma (Mama Granbags)
* Looney Bird (Gooney Bird)
* McVite Bear of Scotland (Billy Bill)

* Paddy Bear of Ireland (Billy Boy)
* Dai Bear of Wales (Billy Bob)
