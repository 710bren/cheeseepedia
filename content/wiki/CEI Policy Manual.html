<p>The <b><i>Creative Engineering, Inc. Policy Manual</b></i> is a lost manual for CEI employees.</p>
<p>The only evidence of the manual's existence is a scan of the front cover art, drawn by Dave Thomas.<sup>[1]</sup> The manual was half-letter sized, being 8.5' x 5.5'.<sup>[2]</sup></p>
<p><h2> Lost Media </h2></p>
<p>The currently only known copy was located in <i>Snapper's Blast to the Past Museum</i>, which burned from a fog machine accident in October of 2010. The manual was not recovered from the rubble.<sup>[3]</sup><sup>[4]</sup></p>
