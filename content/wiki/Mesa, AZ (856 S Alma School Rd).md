<b><i>856 S Alma School Rd, Store #216/2084,</b></i> also known as <b><i>West Mesa</b></i>, was a Showbiz Pizza Place that opened on August 30, 1984, as a corporate location with a Rock-Afire Explosion and closed on August 24, 2015, as a CEC with a Studio C Alpha.

It was located in an unnamed shopping center. This location is not to be confused with [Mesa, AZ (7012 E Hampton Ave)]({{< ref "wiki/Mesa, AZ (7012 E Hampton Ave).md" >}}) (<b><i>East Mesa</b></i>) which opened in December 2003 (day unknown) and closed on December 20, 2018 with a Studio C Beta, 16M. 
<h2>History</h2>
West Mesa opened on August 30th, 1984 as a corporate-owned location. West Mesa opened with the [Rock-Afire Explosion]({{< ref "wiki/Classic Stage.md" >}}) and a very weird exterior. In the Late 80's, West Mesa received a change to the Billy Bob stage. In 1990, West Mesa received [Concept Unification]({{< ref "wiki/Concept Unification.md" >}}) and the 1986 SPT Remodel Program (1988 Remodel) including the removal of the SPP decor for CU decor, the ball pit, the Blue and White awnings, the checkers around the store, the renaming of the restaurant, and the conversion of the Rock-Afire Explosion for the [3-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/Concept Unification Stage.md" >}}). Around 1998, They replaced the logo with Coach Chuck and removed older 90's decor for newer decor, the Blue and White awnings, some checkers around the store, the removal of the ball pit for [Skytubes]({{< ref "wiki/Skytubes.md" >}}), and the removal of the 3-Stage for the Studio C (1997) (Studio C Alpha). West Mesa remained like this until 2009/2010, when they received the 2005 update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative which involved the removal of the showroom walls, removing older decor for newer decor, new booths, relocating the stage, & adding purple walls. Strangely, after it received the 2005 remodel but before closure, the logos next to the 2005 logo were not changed. West Mesa remained like this until August 24th, 2015 when the location would close after 31 years in operation. It's unknown why West Mesa closed but a theory suggests a lease disagreement, or loss of business. After closure, it remained abandoned with all CEC remnants inside until in 2016 when it was repainted and all CEC Remnants (except for the showroom without the Studio C animatronics and awnings on the exterior) were removed. In 2019, the location became a pet store known as 'Pratt's Pets'. Currently, as of July 2023, Pratt's Pets is still on the space.
<h2>Stages</h2>
Originally, when the store opened, the location had a Rock-Afire Explosion stage. It received Concept Unification in 1990 and converted the Rock-Afire Explosion to the 3-Stage. In 1998, the 3-Stage was removed for the new at the time, Studio C Alpha stage. In August 2015, the location closed and the Alpha bot was thrown out and its parts were sent to other locations.
