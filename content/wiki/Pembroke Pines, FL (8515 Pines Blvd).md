##History##
Pembroke Pines opened on September 11th, 1991, as a corporate-owned location. Pembroke Pines opened with the 1988 Remodel including the CU decor, and the Road Stage. Around the mid-late 1990's, They replaced the logo with Coach Chuck and removed older 90's decor for newer decor and the removal of the ball pit for SkyTubes. Around 2007-2008, Pembroke Pines remodeled to the 2005 update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative which involved the removal of the showroom walls, removing older decor for newer decor, new booths, & adding purple walls. Pembroke Pines remained like this until April 2022 when they received the 2.0 remodel and removed the Road Stage for the Dance Floor.
