**Mentor, OH (7900 Plaza Blvd)** was a Pizza Time Theatre which opened in June 1982 with a [Balcony Stage]({{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage.md" >}}). It should not be confused with [Mentor, OH (8000 Plaza Blvd)]({{< ref "wiki/Mentor, OH (8000 Plaza Blvd).md" >}}), which is the current Chuck E. Cheese's location that opened on July 20th, 1998 with a 1-Stage and is still open to this day. 

This location, alongside Akron,[ Huntington Beach]({{< ref "wiki/Huntington Beach, CA (15511 Edwards St).md" >}}), Boardman, and another unknown store would be previewed in a video showcasing the 1986 SPT Remodel Program benefits.

Mentor would eventually become one of 5 Pizza Time Theatres to be rebranded as Marc's Funtime Pizza Palace. It was located in the Erie Commons Shopping Mall.

## History ##

### Pizza Time Theatre ###
Mentor opened as a Pizza Time Theatre in June 1982 with a Balcony Stage and also featured The King, and Dolli Dimples. In 1988-1989, Mentor received the 1988 Remodel removing the Balcony Stage in favor of Chuck E.â€™s House Facade, adding Blue and White awnings, replacing some decor with newer decor though some stayed behind, and checkers. Mentor stayed like this until the franchise owner left and was purchased in December 1991 by Marc Glassman.

### Marc's Funtime Pizza Palace ###
In December 1991, Marc Glassman, owner of the Marc's grocery chain, purchased the Mentor Pizza Time Theatre when the franchise owner left the area, and the store was converted to Marc's Funtime Pizza Palace. He also purchased the Boardman, Akron, Columbus (Columbus Square), and North Olmsted locations. Like the other Marc's locations, Mentor location would keep the existing stage, but convert the characters into Marc, Rita, Ally, Fletch, and Chops. Mentor would end up closing in 1996.
