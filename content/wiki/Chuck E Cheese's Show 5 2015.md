<h2> Trivia: </h2>

* 'All For Fun, Fun For All' and 'Dancin' Kitten' are originally from Chuck E. Cheese's Winter 2015 (Winter 2015)
* 'Most Epic Mouse' and 'It's A Date' were originally not programmed due to the move at corporate. They were programmed by Show 72015 International. They would then appear in the US stores with Chuck E. Cheese's Show 1 2016 (Show 1 2016) for 'Most Epic Mouse' and Chuck E. Cheese's Show 2 2016 (Show 2 2016) for 'It's A Date'
* Pasqually's Brother is a CEC Sketch written by Chris Hill.
* 'It's a Date' marks Ronnie the Unicorn's first appearance. 'Counting Sheep' from Chuck_E._Cheese's_Show_6_2015 (the next showtape) would mark his first speaking role. He would later be a side character after this showtape's release.
