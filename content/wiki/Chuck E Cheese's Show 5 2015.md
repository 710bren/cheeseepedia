* 'Most Epic Mouse' and 'It's A Date' were originally not programmed due to the move at corporate. They were programmed by Show 72015 International.

* 'It's a Date' marks Ronnie the Unicorn's first appearance. 'Counting Sheep' from Chuck_E._Cheese's_Show_6_2015 (the next showtape) would mark his first speaking role. He would later be a side character after this showtape's release.
