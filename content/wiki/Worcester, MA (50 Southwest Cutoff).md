**Worcester, MA (50 Southwest Cutoff)** is a Chuck E. Cheese's location that opened in August 1992. 

## History ##
Worcester opened August 18th, 1992 in Southwest Commons. The location originally featured a 2-Stage. Unlike many of them at the time, this location had Jasper's banjo, much like Burlington, which opened 2 weeks prior. Sometime from 1995-1997, they changed out their original sign for a Coach Chuck sign. Between 1999-2002, some changes were made to the characters, including Helen and Pasqually getting a new mask and Jasper's shirt, Pasqually's apron, and Helen's dress being replaced. Chuck received the Cool Chuck outfit that year as well, and the stage switched to lift curtains by 2004, which is when they were disabled. That fall, Worcester remodeled to the 2005 Remodel, which made it the first CEC in Massachusetts to get the remodel. 

The stage remained the same until the 2010's rolled around, which is when Helen again got her third mask, and Chuck had the Avenger shirt by this time. In 2013, Chuck got his khakis replaced with the Avenger shorts, the Munch's Make Believe Band sign was removed, and Jasper's banjo was broken in half, being replaced with the 3-Stage cheese guitar. The lift curtains were removed the next year. Worcester would remain mostly the same after this, with the exception of Pasqually's drum being flipped around, and the Ticket Blaster decal placed on the now front side.

In October of 2021, Worcester removed their 2-Stage, to be replaced by the Chuck E. Live Stage (Dance Floor) (Dance Floor) and Video Wall as part of the remodel to 2.0. The top halves of Chuck E., Helen, and Jasper would be sent to Lowell, replacing their halves. Pasqually's mask would make its way to [North Dartmouth]({{< ref "wiki/North Dartmouth, MA (412-418 State Rd).md" >}}) to replace their mask. Worcester had their grand reopening ceremony on January 12th, 2022, where Helen Henny would make an appearance.
