## Trivia: ##
* Jasper got a brand new puppet and Pasqually got a redesigned puppet. 
* The Birthday show was modified with this show. The announcer for the Birthday show was replaced with the 2015 Birthday announcer footage and the final minute was reused completely from Birthday 2015 with the Birthday 2016 Countdown being added. The 'Party Promise' was removed and replaced with time allowed for employees to list the names and ages of the birthday guests and lastly all footage using the puppets were reshot.
* This show featured a brand new generic countdown featuring Donovan in front of the Green Room set.
* 'Billy & The Bully' has a unique title card saying **Chuck E. Cheese's Presents** which is only seen on Studio C/Weigl versions. It also is the first show to introduce the [Whatnots]({{< ref "wiki/Whatnots.md" >}}), replacing the store bought puppets like Hard Hat Hank.
