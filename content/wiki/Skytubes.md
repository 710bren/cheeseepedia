## History ##
In the early 90s [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_Zone Discovery Zone] and Chuck E. Cheese was starting to become competitors in the Children's Entertainment Market. With this ever growing conflict CEC started to install more tubes and slides into the ball pits. This also lead to the redesign Chuck E. Cheese, giving him a sports outfit and later updating his look to be more mouse-like. 

This competition between CEC and DZ lead to a major expansion of the tubes with the [Phase 1 (1994)]({{< ref "wiki/Phase 1 (1994).md" >}}) games package and given the name of 'Sky Crawl'.  Then after the initial tests in Phase 1, the Sky Crawl was given a new name, The 'Skytubes'. The Skytubes were starting to being downgraded every update or remodel, they were originally able to take up an entire game room but after 2005 they only took up a corner. Eventually they were being phased out in the 2010s then completely being phased out in 2020 due to the Coronavirus.



The original test of the Sky Crawl had a marquee that read 'Chuck E. Cheese's' in front of the tubes, a ball pit area for toddlers, and 'The Chucksters' Lean Mean Cleaning Machine'.
