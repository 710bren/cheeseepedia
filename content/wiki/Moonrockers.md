The Moonrockers are a Rockafire Explosion retrofit created by Burt “Sal” Wilson in 1985. Only one set was created and is currently being moved to the new Creative Engineering Museum. They are is a state of disrepair, and are no longer functioning. 

The band consists of 6 characters, as it is only a center stage. Ozone is on the “holo drums” on the left, as he was previously Dook. Fatz turned into Admiral Orc. He is the leader of the band. Beach Bear translated into Quazar. He plays the “Lazar” guitar. On the far right stands Princess Hailey. There is no sun, or moon. Though, there is an equivalent to Choo-Choo and Antioch. Choo-Choo turned into Molgama, also known as rock baby, or volcano baby. Antioch turned into a red moon bat named Sismis. The Moonrockers are occasionally referred to as the “Moon Goons”. The music hasn’t been released to the public, but we do know 2 songs. “We’re the Moonrockers”, an introduction to the band, and “The Cyclops Boogie”. The ladder of the two has no info other than the name. The introduction has been pieced together by fans on youtube. It is currently unknown if the full showtape will be released to the public.

Most recently, the official Rockafire youtube channel has made a video showcasing the beginning of premium footage. Starring in it, is the Moon Goons, being packed up for the museum.


TRIVIA————

Princess Hailey has a shiny moon, and star on her face. This was presumed to light up in the spotlight. (Discovered by TJ the DJ)

Quazar eats lizards

They live inside of the moon, not on the surface. This is why you cannot see them using a telescope.

It is unknown if the moonrockers live inside of the actual moon, or the moon from the Rockafire.

They were showcased at the IAAPA while Mitzi’s voice actor would perform along side them.

The Moonrockers songs were designed with missing lyrics in order to have someone perform alongside them.

The Moonrockers have a beta design, only having few differences. (such as Hailey's pink ears)
