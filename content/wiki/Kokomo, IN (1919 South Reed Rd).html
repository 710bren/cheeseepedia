<p><b><i>1919 South Reed Rd, Store #341</b></i> is a Chuck E. Cheese's that opened on April 6, 2004 and is still open today with a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Studio C Cappa" >}}">Studio C Cappa</a>.</p>
<p><h2> Stage </h2></p>
<p>Kokomo opened with a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Studio C Cappa" >}}">Studio C Cappa</a>, one of four installed in Indiana. Not much is known about the stage, but in 2013, the cap was removed and in 2022, the bot stopped receiving programming.</p>
<p><h2> History </h2></p>
<p>Kokomo opened on April 6, 2004 with the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Phase 3 (2000)" >}}">Phase 3</a> game package and a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Studio C Cappa" >}}">Studio C Cappa</a>. It is located across from the Kokomo Town Center. However, barely any documentation exists on this store online due to lack of documentation.</p>
<p>In 2007/2008, Kokomo received bits of the 2005 update to the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/CEC 2005 Remodel Program" >}}">CEC 2005 Remodel Program</a>, which removed dim lighting, expanded the location to the left, and added 05 decor. Further bits of Phase 3 were removed soon after, most recently the wall planters, as well as the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Skytubes" >}}">Skytubes</a> by 2018/2019. As of October 2023, Kokomo remains open to this day.</p>
