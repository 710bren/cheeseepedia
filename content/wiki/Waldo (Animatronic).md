## Design ##
In his design at Americana Amusement Park, he wore a black bowler hat and yellow tie with red polka dots. At Morey's Piers, he wore a blue tie with small yellow polka dots and a white and blue striped vest. He also carried a rubber chicken in his right hand.

## Movements ##
Due to lack of footage or photos of internals, movements can only be inferred. All that is known is that he along with the rest of the bots in the show had very limited movement.
