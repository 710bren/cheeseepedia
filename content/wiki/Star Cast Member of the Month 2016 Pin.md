The design is a golden star with _Rockstar Chuck E._ raising his arms in triumph. The year is at the top in purple, while the title is printed onto a white box. The pin is metal, with a gold color. Various parts are painted. The text on the pin says:

<code>2016 STAR CAST MEMBER OF THE MONTH</code>
##Acquirement##
Employees could receive this pin by being the most outstanding cast member out of all employees for the month. Similar to the standard 'Employee of the Month' rewards given at other businesses. This reward was at the manager's discretion, and could even not be given out for the month.
