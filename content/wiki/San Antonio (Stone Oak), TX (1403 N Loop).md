**_San Antonio (Stone Oak), TX (1403 N Loop)**_ was a _Chuck E. Cheese's_ that opened on January 8th, 2002 with a Studio C Beta.

This location was the first to receive the 2.0 remodel in 2017. 
##Stages##
This location opened with a Studio C Beta, featuring the 32-movement Chuck E. Cheese animatronic. created by Garner Holt. The show would remain in good condition for most of its life, the character's head up movement would be stuck for its last few months of operation. It's worth noting that in 2010, the character would get the 'Avenger' shorts and shirt while keeping the hat from the 'Cool Chuck' outfit. In late 2017, Studio C would be removed and replaced with the first 2.0 version of the Chuck E. Live Stage (Dance Floor).
##History##
Not much from this location's early years is known or documented. In the mid 2000s, Stone Oak would undergo the 2005 remodel while keeping the original lights and exterior. In late 2011 or early 2012, the exterior was updated to match the 2005 remodel exterior. The interior lights were upgraded to fluorescents before 2014. This location would be the first to receive the 2.0 remodel, with construction beginning in June 2017 and finishing in August 2017.
