**1431 22nd St** was a Showbiz Pizza Place that opened on October 13, 1980 with a Rock-Afire Explosion, which is still open to this day.

This location was the 5th Showbiz to open, and the 4th RAE installed, they would receive Concept Unification in 1991 or 1992, and still have the 3-Stage, being the last animatronic show in the state of Iowa.

##  History ## 
West Des Moines opened on October 13th, 1980 and was the first Showbiz Pizza Place opened in the state of Iowa, there were 3 other Showbiz's opened in the state, Davenport, which is still open with a Dance Floor, Cedar Rapids, which closed in 2013, and Cedar Falls, which closed and relocated in 2001. West Des Moines had the 4th Rock-Afire Explosion installed, and was the 5th Showbiz Pizza Place opened (Kansas City Antioch had the Wolf Pack 5 when they opened in March 1980). They would receive Concept Unification in the 1990's, and has been through a few remodels, the most recent being the 2005 Remodel in the 2000's.

##  Stages ## 
Originally when the store opened, they had a Rock-Afire Explosion, they were the 4th RAE installed, and originally had the 'Beta' bots, which had hollow frames, unlike the later ones, which have solid frames. They would replace the original bots in 1981, as all other 'Beta' shows. In around 1991 or 1992, they would undergo Concept Unification, this was the process used to convert the RAE characters into the Chuck E. Cheese characters. As of October 2022, they still have the 3-Stage, with it also being the last 3-Stage in Iowa, but also the last animatronic stage in the state, as Davenport (second Showbiz in the state) and Cedar Falls (relocation of the fourth Showbiz in the state, which relocated in 2001) are both 2.0.
