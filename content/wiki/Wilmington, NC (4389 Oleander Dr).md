**4389 Oleander Dr, Wilmington, NC 28403** was a Showbiz Pizza Place that opened on July 23, 1984 with a Rock-Afire Explosion, which closed October 13, 2020.

This location received Concept Unification in 1991, and had the last Munch Jr. animatronic until they closed, making it extinct.

##  History ##

##  Stages ## 
Originally when the store opened, they had a Rock-Afire Explosion, as all other Showbiz locations had. Wilmington's show was manufactured in January of 1982, being batch number 1. They would have the RAE for a few years, until 1991, when they would receive Concept Unification, this was the process used to turn the RAE into the Chuck E. Cheese characters. They would have the 3-Stage until they closed. They would have the last Munch Jr. animatronic in-store. They would also be the only location so far to have the full 'Rockstar' outfit (shirt and jeans), other than Dept. 18's programming show.
