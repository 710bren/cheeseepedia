[[File:Melrose Park!.jpg|thumb|Melrose Park's exterior in June 2011, not very long before closure. (PC: Google Maps)]]
**_1315 W North Ave**_ was a Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza that opened on September 24, 1991 (same day as [Placentia]({{< ref "wiki/Placentia, CA (2300 N Rose Dr).md" >}})) with a Road Stage and closed/relocated to the current location ([1030 Winston Plaza]({{< ref "wiki/Melrose Park, IL (1030 Winston Plaza).md" >}})) in August 2012 (day unknown) with a 2-Stage. They had a very unique exterior, with the Thumb Chuck logo containing the words 'FOOD, FAMILY & FUN'. 

## History ##
Melrose Park opened on September 24, 1991 with a Road Stage and the 1988 update to the 1986 SPT Remodel Program, containing checkers around the store, awnings above the menu, prize area, and salad bar, late '80s décor, and of course, the Road Stage itself. One weird thing to note is that the ceiling was very low, so the stage had to be installed on the ground. Melrose Park remained like this until the mid '90s, when they would receive their final change, the 1993 remodel, receiving [Phase 1]({{< ref "wiki/Phase 1 (1994).md" >}}) or [2]({{< ref "wiki/Phase 2 (1997).md" >}}). This involved removal of the Road Stage for a 2-Stage, removing older décor for newer décor, removing the awnings above the salad bar, replacing the ball pit with the Skytubes, changing the exterior, and refurbishing the counters. In August 2012, the location completed it's final day, and shut its doors for good. The reason is that the owners didn't have enough money to remodel the store, so they relocated so it was easier to remodel. The building remained vacant for a couple of months until the store was demolished in 2013 for Olive Garden. As of June 2023, Olive Garden is still on the space.

## Stages ##
Melrose Park contained a Finalized Road Stage, being installed in September 1991. One thing to note about this stage, was that the stage was installed on the ground because the store's ceiling was very low. In the mid '90s, the Road Stage was removed and replaced with the 2-Stage, with the same ceiling problem. By the late 2000s or early 2010s, the curtains were removed from the stage. The 2-Stage would stay there until the August 2012 closure. The fate of their show is unknown.
