[[File:Laguna Hills.jpg|thumb|Laguna Hill's exterior as of today. (PC: Google Maps)]]
**_26538-H Moulton Pkwy**_ is a Chuck E. Cheese's that opened in Fall 2001 (month and day unknown) and is still open to this day with a Studio C 2000 (Studio C Beta, 32m). 

This location is the relocation of the infamous [Lake Forest, CA (24416 Muirlands Blvd)]({{< ref "wiki/Lake Forest, CA (24416 Muirlands Blvd).md" >}}) location, which opened in June 1981 (day unknown) and closed in Fall 2001 (month and day unknown) with a Cyberamics Portrait / Shelf Stage (Portrait Stage) (formerly thought to be a [Balcony Stage]({{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage.md" >}})).

## Stages ##
When Laguna Hills opened, they housed a Studio C Beta, which they had since opening. Not much changes happened, besides the removal of curtains, and the bot no longer being programmed. Laguna Hill's stage still remains like this.

## History ##
Laguna Hills opened in Fall 2001 (month and day unknown) with a Studio C Beta stage and [Phase 3]({{< ref "wiki/Phase 3 (2000).md" >}}) of the 1990s Major Remodel (1993 remodel). They also had a different exterior rather than the current one. In 2006/2007, Laguna Hills received the 2005 update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative, which involved removing most 90s decor for new decor, tearing down the showroom walls, replaced the dim lighting, and changed the exterior. In the early 2010s, the shopping center received an exterior refresh, changing the exterior once again, but the Avenger logo was kept. As of July 2023, Laguna Hills remains operational to this day.
