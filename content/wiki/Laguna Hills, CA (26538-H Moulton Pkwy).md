<b><i>26538-H Moulton Pkwy, Store #3022/378</b></i> is a Chuck E. Cheese's that opened in Fall 2001 (month and day unknown) and is still open to this day with the CEC 2018 2.0 Remodel Program (2.0 Remodel). 

This location is the relocation of the [Lake Forest, CA (24416 Muirlands Blvd)]({{< ref "wiki/Lake Forest, CA (24416 Muirlands Blvd).md" >}}) location, which opened in June 1981 (day unknown) and closed in Fall 2001 (month and day unknown) with a Cyberamics Portrait / Shelf Stage (Portrait Stage).

<h2>Stages</h2>
When Laguna Hills opened, it housed a Studio C Beta. Besides removing curtains, a few changes happened, and the bot was no longer being programmed in 2022. Laguna Hill's stage was removed in Late 2023 and was replaced with a Dance Floor + Video Wall.

<h2>History</h2>
Laguna Hills opened in Fall 2001 (month and day unknown) with a Studio C Beta stage and [Phase 3]({{< ref "wiki/Phase 3 (2000).md" >}}) of the SPT 1992/1993 Remodel Program (1993 remodel). They also had a different exterior rather than the current one. In 2006/2007, Laguna Hills received the [CEC 2005 Remodel Program]({{< ref "wiki/CEC 2005 Remodel Program.md" >}}), which involved removing most 90s decor for new decor, tearing down the showroom walls, replacing the dim lighting, and changing the exterior. In the early 2010s, the shopping center received an exterior refresh, changing the exterior once again, but the Avenger logo was kept. In Late 2023, Laguna Hills received the CEC 2018 2.0 Remodel Program (2.0 Remodel) and removed the Studio C Beta for a Dance Floor + Video Wall. As of January 2024, Laguna Hills remains operational to this day.
