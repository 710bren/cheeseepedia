The **_Winchester Grand Opening Advertisement**_ was distributed by the Atari sub-division of Warner Communications Incorporated in May 1977, to advertise the new family concept of Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre which would make its debut on 370 South Winchester Boulevard located in the Town & Country Shopping Center in San Jose, California. 

## History ##
While no specific data is documented outside of the flyer itself, we can speculate that this was produced and distributed by the Atari sub-division of Warner Communications Incorporated from early May 1977 to May 17, 1977. The advertisement was distributed around the San Jose area to build an audience for the upcoming Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre opening on 370 South Winchester Boulevard.
