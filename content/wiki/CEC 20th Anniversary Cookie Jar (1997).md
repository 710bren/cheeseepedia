<h2>Design</h2>
The cookie jar is based off of Chuck E. Cheese's 'Tuxedo Era', with Chuck E. holding a large cake reading 'Chuck E. Cheese's 20th Anniversary' on the front and a small pile of tokens on the top.

The cookie jar is accessed by Chuck E.'s head being removed, revealing the hallow inside of the figure to allow for maximum storage.
