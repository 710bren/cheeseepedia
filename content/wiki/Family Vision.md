**_Family Vision**_ were a collection of monthly Betamax tapes released to _Showbiz Pizza Place_ stores starting in 1986.

The tapes would provide video entertainment to guests during the downtime between showtape segments. The videos would be projected onto a screen that would automatically come down once a show ended. The tapes themselves were charged at $55 a month once a store agreed to be in the program.

## History ##
The tapes were produced mainly by _Sight & Sound Entertainment Corporation_, under their _Video Pool_<ref>[[:File:02df9348f91b3ae08bef4863a63c2c2d.png|File:02df9348f91b3ae08bef4863a63c2c2d.png]]</ref> line. Video Pool had been around on Betamax tapes since March of 1984, published to other vendors, with _Sight & Sound_ being an intermediary for handling the mass tape production and acquisition of copyrighted video material. Each tape would be around 30 minutes long, and were produced until Cyberstar fully took over all _Showbiz_ locations in late 1989. Some of the early tapes seemed to have _Dallas Tapes_ on their label, but it is unclear their involvement in the project.
