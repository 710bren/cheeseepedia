<b><i>1151 Creek Rd</b></i> was a {{< wiki-link "Charlie Cheese's Pizza Playhouse" >}} that opened in 1982 with a {{< wiki-link "Cyberamics Balcony Stage" >}} and closed between 1984 and 1986.
This store was a relocation of the {{< wiki-link "Surfer's Paradise, Queensland, Australia" >}} location and would be the last location to open in Australia.
<h2> Stage </h2>
Charlie Cheese's would have a standard {{< wiki-link "Cyberamics Balcony Stage" >}} and would have Cyberamic characters likely to have came from the {{< wiki-link "Surfer's Paradise, Queensland, Australia" >}}. Because of this it is well to say that this location kept the Madam Oink character until they received the Bandstand Show in-around 1984.
It is also unknown if they've also relocated the Dolli Dimples Cyberamic to this new location.
<h2> History </h2>
Little is known about this store as opposed to it's {{< wiki-link "Surfer's Paradise, Queensland, Australia" >}} other than the location closing due to Pizza Time Theatre's bankruptcy.
