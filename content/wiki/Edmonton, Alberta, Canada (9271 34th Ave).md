<b>9271 34th Avenue</b> was a Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre that opened in November 1985 with a Balcony Stage, which closed in 1995.

This store was the second last Balcony Stage store to open, as well as the second last PTT to open, both being before [Fairbanks, Alaska (600 Old Steese Hwy)]({{< ref "wiki/Fairbanks, AK (600 Old Steese Hwy).md" >}}), which opened in January 1986.

Edmonton would be the last Balcony Stage, being replaced in 1993 with a 2-Stage.

<h2> History </h2>

<h2> Stages </h2>
Originally when the store opened, they featured a Balcony Stage. Edmonton's Balcony was the second last installed in a new store, with Edmonton also being the second last new PTT to open. They would have it until a time frame of between. The 2-Stage would not last very long, as they would permanently close in 1995.
