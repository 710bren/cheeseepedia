{{Animatronic|releasedate=1978|manufacturer=Creative Engineering|image=queen_1979.jpg}}**_Queenie / Mini Mozzarella**_ was an animatronic created for the [Wolf Pack 5]({{< ref "wiki/Wolf Pack 5.md" >}}) show and debuted at the 1978 IAAPA.

She uses the same mask mold as [Grandma Bear]({{< ref "wiki/Grandma Bear (Animatronic).md" >}})/Beatrice from the [Bear Country Jubilee]({{< ref "wiki/Bear Country Jubilee.md" >}}) and a nearly identical mech as Mama Grandbags from the [Hard Luck Bears]({{< ref "wiki/Hard Luck Bears.md" >}}).

## History ##
During the creation of the [Rock Afire Explosion]({{< ref "wiki/Rock-afire Explosion.md" >}}) in 1980, Queenie was going to be reused as a character much like the rest of the Wolf Pack 5. However, marketing executive for [Showbiz Pizza Place]({{< ref "wiki/ShowBiz Pizza Place.md" >}}), Stan Emmerson suggested replacing her with a mouse to go with the pizza theme and because [Pizza Time Theatre]({{< ref "wiki/Pizza Time Theatre.md" >}}) and Disney both had mouse mascots. In an attempt to not come off as arrogant, Aaron Fetcher allowed for Queenie to be converted into Mini Mozzarella.<ref>https://youtu.be/0l6-6ewuY70?si=Y5rDQN6zixww5rJC&t=452</ref>

## Design ##
Queenie is a red fox positioned on the far right of the stage. At the 1978 IAAPA, she wore a dark blue scarf, light blue button-up shirt, black jeans, and black and white saddle shoes. After the 1979 IAAPA, she wore a white shirt, skirt with various colors depending on location, black and white saddle shoes, and a rose in her right hand. This would become the standard design. During her conversion to Mini, she would be given a mouse tail.
