##History##
St. Petersburg opened its doors in March 1983 with a Balcony Stage. It was originally a franchised-owned Pizza Time Theatre location, being one of the few that survived PTT's bankruptcy and was bought on October 22, 1984 along with many other locations by the corporate. Like all locations at some point, it remodeled twice in the late 80's and early 1990s to be up to standard. They replaced the Balcony Stage with the C-Stage. The C-Stage was replaced by the 2-Stage shortly after.

In 2005-2006, St. Petersburg received the 2005 Remodel and removed the Showroom Walls, Balcony Seating, and removing the 2-Stage for the Studio C Beta and relocating it.

Around 2020 or 2021, St. Petersburg's front exterior sign was replaced with the 2.0 sign because it was suffering due to old age.

In December 2022, the location officially remodeled again to CEC's 2.0 remodel removing the Beta for the Dance Floor and Video Wall.
