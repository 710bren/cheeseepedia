**600 Old Steese Highway** was a Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre that opened in January 1986 with The Stage, which closed in 1988.

This location was the last Pizza Time Theatre location to open, as well as the last store to open with The Stage (Balcony Stage).

## History ##
Fairbanks opened in January 1986 as the 2nd Pizza Time Theatre to open in the state of Alaska, the other being Anchorage (which is still open to this day.), with The Stage (aka the Balcony Stage). Fairbanks was the last true Pizza Time Theatre store to open, as Showbiz Pizza Place, Inc. (parent company of the [Showbiz Pizza Place]({{< ref "wiki/Showbiz Pizza Place.md" >}}) chain of FEC's.) acquired Pizza Time Theatre, Inc. (parent company of Pizza Time Theatre.) after they filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy in March 1984, and slowly stopped opening new Pizza Time Theatres, as well as new Showbiz Pizza Places. As Fairbanks was the last PTT to open, and that every PTT received a Balcony Stage (except for the PTT's opened between May 1977 and December 1980, which opened with Portrait Stages.), Fairbanks was the last store opened with a Balcony Stage. 

Fairbanks would only be open for a short period, closing sometime in 1988.

## Stages ##
As with every Pizza Time Theatre, Fairbanks opened with The Stage (aka the Balcony Stage). As stated above, Fairbanks was the last PTT to open, and so was also the last Balcony Stage to be installed. As they opened after 1983 (when Guest Stars were retired), they only featured Helen Henny. It is not known if they had any Cabaret acts.
