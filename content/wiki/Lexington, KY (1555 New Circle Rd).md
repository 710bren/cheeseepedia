<b>1555 New Circle Rd, Store #963</b> was a Showbiz Pizza Place that opened on December 1, 1983 with a Rock-Afire Explosion, which is still open to this day.

This location received Concept Unification either in 1991 or 1992, which was replaced with a Studio C Beta, 16m in 2007 or 2008, and then received 2.0 in 2019.

<h2> History </h2>
Lexington opened on December 1st, 1983 as the second Showbiz Pizza Place in Kentucky, after [Paducah]({{< ref "wiki/Paducah, KY (5141 Hinkleville Rd).md" >}}) which opened the year prior, in the Woodhill Circle Plaza. Lexington received the SPP 1988 Remodel (1988 Remodel) in around 1998-1989. They then underwent Concept Unification in 1991. Lexington then received another remodel in the Mid 1990's which involved the removal of elements from the 1988 remodel such as The Blue & White Awnings, checkers around the store, & neon lights. Then in 2006 or 2007, they received the CEC 2005 Remodel which involved the store being expanded, therefore gutting the current showroom, replacing the 3-Stage with a Studio C Beta 16m, & turning the current Showroom into a gameroom. Then they would receive the 2.0 Remodel in 2019, replacing the Studio C Beta 16m with a Dance Floor. As of October 2022, they are the second last former Showbiz in Kentucky, as the Owensboro location closed in 1998. They were a franchise store, and were acquired by corporate on September 16th, 1996, along with many other locations and closing Rochester (Penfield), NY.

<h2> Stages </h2>
Originally, Lexington had a Rock-Afire Explosion, as all other Showbiz Pizza Place's did, they would have it for a few years, until sometime in 1991, when they would undergo a process known as Concept Unification, this was to replace the RAE with the Chuck E. Cheese characters. They would have the [3-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/Concept Unification Stage.md" >}}) until either 2006 or 2007, when they would replace it with a [Studio C Beta]({{< ref "wiki/Studio C Beta.md" >}}), 16m, this was the first and only [Studio C Beta]({{< ref "wiki/Studio C Beta.md" >}}) in Kentucky, as Louisville has a [Studio C Alpha]({{< ref "wiki/Studio C Alpha.md" >}}), and Bowling Green had a [Studio C Cappa]({{< ref "wiki/Studio C Cappa.md" >}}). They would have the Beta until 2019, when they would undergo the 2.0 remodel, replacing the Studio C Beta with a Chuck E. Live Stage (Dance Floor) (Dance Floor). They were the second 2.0 in the state, after [Paducah]({{< ref "wiki/Paducah, KY (5141 Hinkleville Rd).md" >}}), which received 2.0 in 2018. Lexington would be the most recent 2.0 in Kentucky until March of 2022, when [Florence]({{< ref "wiki/Florence, KY (7635 Mall Rd).md" >}}) would receive 2.0, and then [Bowling Green]({{< ref "wiki/Bowling Green, KY (2625 Scottsville Rd).md" >}}) received it in June of 2022, making Louisville the last non-2.0 store in Kentucky.
