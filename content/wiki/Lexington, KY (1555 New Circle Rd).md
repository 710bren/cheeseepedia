**1555 New Circle Rd** was a Showbiz Pizza Place that opened on December 1, 1983 with a Rock-Afire Explosion, which is still open to this day.

## History ##
Lexington opened on December 1st, 1983 as the second Showbiz Pizza Place in Kentucky, after [Paducah]({{< ref "wiki/Paducah, KY (5141 Hinkleville Rd).md" >}}) which opened the year prior, in the Woodhill Circle Plaza. As of September 2022, they are the second last former Showbiz in Kentucky, as the Owensboro location closed in 1995. They were a franchise store, and were acquired by corporate on September 16, 1996, along with many other locations.

## Stages ##
Originally, Lexington had a Rock-Afire Explosion, as all other Showbiz Pizza Place's did, they would have it for a few years, until either 1991 or 1992, when they would undergo a process known as Concept Unification, this was to replace the RAE with the Chuck E. Cheese characters. They would have the [3-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/Concept Unification Stage.md" >}}) until either 2007 or 2008, when they would replace it with a [Studio C Beta]({{< ref "wiki/Studio C Beta.md" >}}), 16m, this was the first and only [Studio C Beta]({{< ref "wiki/Studio C Beta.md" >}}) in Kentucky, as Louisville has a [Studio C Alpha]({{< ref "wiki/Studio C Alpha.md" >}}), and Bowling Green had a [Studio C Cappa]({{< ref "wiki/Studio C Cappa.md" >}}). They would have the Beta until 2019, when they would undergo the 2.0 remodel, replacing the Studio C Beta with a Chuck E. Live Stage (Dance Floor) (Dance Floor). They were the second 2.0 in the state, after [Paducah]({{< ref "wiki/Paducah, KY (5141 Hinkleville Rd).md" >}}), which received 2.0 in 2018. Lexington would be the most recent 2.0 in Kentucky until March of 2022, when [Florence]({{< ref "wiki/Florence, KY (7635 Mall Rd).md" >}}) would receive 2.0, and then [Bowling Green]({{< ref "wiki/Bowling Green, KY (2625 Scottsville Rd).md" >}}) received it in June of 2022, making Louisville the last non-2.0 store in Kentucky.
