<p><b></b>Chuck E.'s House Facade' (C-Stage)<i></i>' was a prefabricated false front which, when applied over an existing <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage" >}}">Balcony Stage</a>, transforms it into a house.<sup>[1]</sup></p>
<p><h2> History </h2></p>
<p>'Chuck E.â€™s House Facade' supposedly debuted at the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/San Antonio, TX (8220 Windsor Cross)" >}}">Windsor Cross</a> location in 1988-1989 and went extinct in 2003 when the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Tacoma, WA (4911 Tacoma Mall Blvd)" >}}">Tacoma, WA</a> location replaced the facade for Studio C. The Facade would end up becoming the last stage created with the Pizza Time Players positioning-- as the next stage to be produced, the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Concept Unification Stage" >}}">Concept Unification Stage</a>, introduced Munch's Make-Believe Band.</p>
<p><h2> Design </h2></p>
<p>This stage kept the same concept as the Balcony Stage; however, it was now themed to be a house-like setting.</p>
<p>Behind four of the characters sat horizontal siding with windows with lighting behind a pane. The base of which the characters and windows sat had a wall of horizontal siding or railing in front of the original Balcony Stage front with lattice directly under it.</p>
<p>The faux valence of the stage became a shingled roof with popcorn lights above Munch, Chuck E., & Pasqually.</p>
<p>Some installations had a live stage instead of the lattice (some had the distinct 'C', and some didn't). It featured checkered flooring, fencing, and steps to get up.</p>
