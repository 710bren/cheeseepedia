<h2> Stages </h2>
Arvada opened with a Rock-a-fire Explosion stage. The store received Concept Unification in 1991, converting it into a 3-Stage. It also had a unique projector that was only for training employees under The Wink. Pasqually's brick wall was bent into thirds, unlike other 3-Stages, and Munch had blue eyes. The final performance on the 3-Stage was Nothin' Like a Walk.
