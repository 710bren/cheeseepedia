<b><i>Arvada, CO (9301 Ralston Rd), Store #717</b></i> was a <i>ShowBiz Pizza Place</i> that opened on March 31st, 1981 with a [Rock-afire Explosion]({{< ref "wiki/Classic Stage.md" >}}), and closed as a <i>Chuck E. Cheese's</i> on September 20th, 2017 with a [3-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/Concept Unification Stage.md" >}}).

<h2> Stages </h2>
Arvada opened with a Rock-a-fire Explosion stage. The store received Concept Unification in 1991, converting it into a 3-Stage. It also had a unique projector that was only for training employees under The Wink. Pasqually's brick wall was bent into thirds, unlike other 3-Stages, and Munch had blue eyes. The final performance on the 3-Stage was Nothin' Like a Walk.

<h2>History</h2> 
Arvada opened with a [Rock-afire Explosion]({{< ref "wiki/Classic Stage.md" >}}) and as the 15th Showbiz Pizza Place to open in the United States. In 1984, Arvada got the PTT Chuck walkaround along with other SPP locations for birthday parties in favor of Billy Bob. In May of 1990, Arvada would receive the [SPT 1988 Remodel Program]({{< ref "wiki/SPT 1988 Remodel Program.md" >}})  and in 1991 received [Concept Unification]({{< ref "wiki/Concept Unification.md" >}}), converting the Rock-afire Explosion to Munch's Make Believe Band. It is currently unknown when Arvada remodeled to the SPT 1992/1993 Remodel Program and the [CEC 2005 Remodel Program]({{< ref "wiki/CEC 2005 Remodel Program.md" >}}). 

<h2>= Closure </h2>=
