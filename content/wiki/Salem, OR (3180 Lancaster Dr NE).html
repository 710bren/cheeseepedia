<b><i>3180 Lancaster Drive Northeast</b></i> was a <i>Pizza Time Theatre</i> that opened on January 1, 1984, and closed somewhere between 1988-1989 with a [[Cyberamics Balcony Stage|Balcony Stage]].

It was located across from the Oak Park Plaza shopping mall. It relocated to the [Salem, OR (3240 Lancaster Dr NE)]({{< ref "wiki/Salem, OR (3240 Lancaster Dr NE).html" >}}) location which opened around 1988-1989 with [Chuck E.'s House]({{< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House.html" >}}), and is still open to this day as a 2.0 with a [[Chuck E. Live Stage (Dance Floor)|Dance Floor]] and [Video Wall]({{< ref "wiki/Video Wall.html" >}}).

<h2> Stages </h2>
Originally, this location had a Balcony Stage like all other PTTs at the time. This location has hardly any information at all.

It most likely closed between 1988-1989 and the stage was removed.

<h2>History</h2>
Old Salem opened on January 1st, 1984, as the 3rd and last Pizza Time Theatre to open in Oregon. There were no Showbiz Pizzas in Oregon. It opened with the Balcony Stage and Guest Star Helen Henny as the other Guest Star characters were retired in 1983. It remained like this until 1988-1989 when the store was relocated to the 3240 Lancaster Drive Northeast location, meaning it would no longer be across from the Oak Park Plaza but rather, in it. Shortly after it closed, the building was immediately destroyed. Currently, as of right now, the space where it once inhabited is now a parking space for a Mexican restaurant called Los Dos Amigos Hacienda.
