The <b><i>Chuck Jan '04 Costume Outfit</b></i> is a costume outfit that appears in the [January 2004 Show]({{< ref "wiki/January 2004 Show.md" >}}).

It is the same style as the blue and yellow outfit seen in the [September 2003 Show]({{< ref "wiki/September 2003 Show.md" >}}). Both shirts are most likely early versions of what would become the 2003 Chuck E. Cheese outfit. The fur arms are attached to the shirt.
