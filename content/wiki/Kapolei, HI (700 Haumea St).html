<b><i>Kapolei, HI (700 Haumea St.)</b></i> is a franchise <i>Chuck E. Cheese</i> that opened in October 2018 and is still open. Due to long construction, this location is the last to open with the CEC 2015 Remodel Program|2015 Remodel and the last to feature <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Circles of Light" >}}">COL</a> with an animatronic. It is also the only COL with an animatronic to feature a dance floor.
<h2> History </h2>
Kapolei began construction around 2015/2016 and was a learning experience for the franchisee. The location finished in 2018 and later opened the same year. This ended up being an interesting location, containing the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Skytubes" >}}">sky tubes</a> (a bigger Chuck E’s Clubhouse variant) and Avenger-era costumes. As of 2024, Kapolei remains like this.
<h2> Costumes </h2>
more coming soon…
<h2> Stage </h2>
Kapolei has a interesting stage, having a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Circles of Light" >}}">Circles of Light</a> Stage with a 2017 Dance Floor and a 16M Chuck E bot. Unfortunately, The animatronic is in poor condition, judging off a performance in 2022. Also, it has been leaned forward ever since opening in 2018.
