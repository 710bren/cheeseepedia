<h2> Trivia </h2><ul><li>This is the first CEC showtape where Disney was completely involved with the showtape's production.</li><ul><li>Looking closely at 'Party Place' in particular, you can see it was filmed at Disney-MGM Studios' Streets of America, Bay Lake, Disney's Fort Wilderness Campgrounds and the mascots on stage scenes were likely filmed at Disney Village's Pleasure Island.</li></ul></ul>
