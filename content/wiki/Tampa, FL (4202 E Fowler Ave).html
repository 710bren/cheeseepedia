<p><b><i>Tampa, FL (4202 E Fowler Ave)</b></i> is a cancelled ShowBiz Pizza Place that would have been placed in the University of South Florida, per possible request by Aaron Fechter.</p>
<p>Aaron notes the plans as '...it didn't go over that hot. They didn't really see it as anything.'. He theorizes that a junior-high oriented pizza parlor wouldn't have meshed well with the college town.<sup>[1]</sup></p>
<p><h2> Trivia </h2></p><ul><li>Prior to this location's cancellation, this would have been the only ShowBiz Pizza location to be located on a college or school campus. To this day, Chuck E. Cheese does not have any college or school campus locations.</li></ul>
