Holiday Special 1992 is a Christmas themed showtape which played during the holiday season. It was the second Christmas showtape to be produced for Munch's Make Believe Band.

The majority of this show's content would end up being reused for [Holiday '93]({{< ref "wiki/Holiday '93.md" >}}), which would run from 1993 to 1994.
