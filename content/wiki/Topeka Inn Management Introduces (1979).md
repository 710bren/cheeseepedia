The **_Topeka Inn Management Introduces... brochure**_ was published in 1979 as a way of informing the public of their recent business endeavor with Pizza Time Theatre Incorporated, which would later be abandoned once Bob Brock discovered the existence of Aaron Fechter. The brochure would go on to state the history of Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre and inform readers on the future of the franchise deal. 

## History ##
Around 1979, Pizza Time Theatre Incorporated headed by Nolan Bushnell, signed a co-development deal with Topeka Inn Management, a leader in the lodging and food industry, headed by Bob Brock. Shortly after Topeka Inn Management would form a division of their company to suite this new deal titled Pizza Show-Biz Incorporated, which would shortly after publish a brochure with their newly formed deal with Pizza Time Theatre Incorporated, which would speak the benefits of the 2 companies collaborating.

 In June of 1979 Topeka Inn Management, Inc., entered a co-development agreement with Pizza Time Theatres for exclusive development of Pizza Time Theatres in 16 states. 

  Chairman Robert L. Brock said, 'the major capital investment TIM is making obvious evidence of our confidence in the concept' 'It is our intent to develop this concept with sound management techniques, adherence to quality standards, and long-term profitability.' Total operation in the 16-state area will be under the direction of Pizza Show Biz, a separate and fully staffed division of TIM. Pizza Show Biz is actively developing sites in Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma, and Wisconsin.
