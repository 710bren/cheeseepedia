## History ##
TODO: History

## Stages ##
Originally the store had a Rock-Afire Explosion show, as all other Showbiz stores did, and would have this for a few years until September 1992, when the store would undergo a process known as Concept Unification, this was to replace the RAE with the Chuck E. Cheese characters. Paducah was one of the last stores to get CU, as a majority had either gotten it the year prior or before September 1992. A very unique thing is that they kept the old Showbiz wall paneling that was on the sides of the stage, and was the last store to have them. In 2018, the store would be selected as one of the stores to test the brand new at the time, 'CEC Pizzeria & Games' remodel, otherwise known as the 2.0 remodel, this would involve completely overhauling the store, painting inside and outside, new logos, new 'Chuck E. Cheese' wording being Chuck E.'s signature, new wall art, new carpet, new tables, booths, and chairs, removal of the animatronic stage and replacing it with a . Paducah was the last 3-Stage in the state of Kentucky, as the Lexington location received a Studio C Beta, 16m in 2007 or 2008. Paducah was also the second-last Munch's Make Believe Band stage in Kentucky, with the  location having a 2-Stage, Florence received 2.0 in March of 2022, meaning there are no more MMBB stages in Kentucky, or Cyberamic stages, since all others closed prior to the year 2000.
