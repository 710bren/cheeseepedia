**_Columbus, IN (1455 N National Rd), Store #670**_ was a _Chuck E. Cheese's_ that opened on December 8, 2004, with a [Studio C Cappa]({{< ref "wiki/Studio C Cappa.md" >}}), and closed on October 8, 2023<ref>https://www.therepublic.com/2023/10/04/columbus-chuck-e-cheese-to-close-after-this-weekend/</ref> due to unknown reasons.

## History ##
The Columbus, Indiana location opened in December 2004 as a Phase 3 store with a Small-town Studio C in an unnamed strip mall on N National Rd. Later in the store's run, they would receive a few Phase 4 wall decor, such as the red tickets on the wall. Between 2015 and 2018, the store got the Phase 5 Chuck E. sign while keeping the old 'Chuck E. Cheese's' wordmark. Columbus was one of the few stores to keep their old lettering along with getting a Phase 5 Chuck E. sign, along with the [Beaverton, OR]({{< ref "wiki/Beaverton, OR (4145 SW 110th Ave).md" >}}) and [Grapevine, TX]({{< ref "wiki/Grapevine, TX (2755 E Grapevine Mills Circle).md" >}}) locations. The store would remain like this until they permanently closed their doors unexpectedly in early October 2023. It is unknown why they closed. They either could've closed because of a lease disagreement, or because the lease expired for the location and CEC decided not to renew it. Whatever the reason was, Columbus closed permanently and there was nothing people could do about it. The current whereabouts for the Studio C 16M animatronic are now unknown. It either could've been destroyed, disassembled for parts, or sent back to corporate.
