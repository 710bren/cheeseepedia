## History ##
This location opened on December 15, 1983 in the Parkway Parade shopping mall and had a Balcony Stage. However, there is basically no documentation on this location, other than prints marking its opening or advertisements. The location closed in 1985/1986 for unknown reasons, but it might be due to that it was underperforming or parking problems. It was later split up into multiple businesses. As of July 2023, the businesses are still there.
