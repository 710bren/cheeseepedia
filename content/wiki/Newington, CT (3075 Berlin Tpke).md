**_Newington, CT (3075 Berlin Tpke)**_ is a Chuck E. Cheese’s location located in Newington, Connecticut. This location opened on October 29, 1991 as the sister store to [[Norwalk, CA (10949 Firestone Blvd)]].

## Stages## 
This location opened up with a Road Stage and was converted to a 1-stage sometime in the 1995 (which was the only one of it's kind in New England). The 1-stage is different than normal 1-stages as it has the 2-stage props. The Munch’s Make Believe Band sign were removed in around 2014-2015. The sign was never replaced. Munch's hat was removed around June-July 2022.

## History## 
The store received the 2005 remodel package in Fall 2005. In August 2022, they started their 2.0 Remodel which removed the 1-Stage and placing the Video Wall on the right side wall where some of the 2005 remodel posters once stood.

This was one of the five New England locations that was open after 2006 that did not receive the Cool Chuck outfit. Those other four were [[Warwick, RI (650 Bald Hill Rd)]], [[North Dartmouth, MA (412-418 State Rd)]], [[Waterbury, CT (650 Wolcott St)]], & [[Attleboro, MA (287 Washington St)]].
