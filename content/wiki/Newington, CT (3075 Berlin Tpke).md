**_Newington, CT (3075 Berlin Tpke)**_ is a Chuck E. Cheese’s location located in Newington, Connecticut. This location opened on October 29, 1991 as the sister store to [Norwalk, CA (10949 Firestone Blvd)]({{< ref "wiki/Norwalk, CA (10949 Firestone Blvd).md" >}}).

##Stages##
This location opened up with a Road Stage and was converted to a 1-stage sometime in the 1995 (which was the only one of it's kind in New England). The 1-stage is different than normal 1-stages as it has the 2-stage props. The Munch’s Make Believe Band sign were removed in around 2014-2015. The sign was never replaced. Munch's hat was removed around June-July 2022.
