**_Studio C Premiere**_ was released in December 1997 and ran until September 1998.

This show was eventually modified and re-edited for MMBB stores with the [May 1998 Show]({{< ref "wiki/May 1998 Show.md" >}}).

## DVCAM Footage ##
The first full footage of the show would be provided by Brian Hagan on December 21, 2021.<ref>https://youtu.be/9xgTdyDk2Pc</ref> This was through a DVCAM recording of the show video spliced with recordings of the [Studio C]({{< ref "wiki/Studio C.md" >}}) stage performing the showtape. This recording would additionally be AI upscaled.

The footage would be copyright-striked minutes after upload, but was able to be downloaded before being pulled. The footage would be reuploaded multiple times with cut down segments, but improved video clarity.<ref>https://youtu.be/sB1_nX3Ydpc</ref>

## Trivia: ##

* This was the second Studio C Premiere created the first being created in October 1997 with nothing known about its existence. But going off pics from its time it lacked Bird meaning it would have to be very different than what eventually came. 
* This show officially played at any Studio C store that opened from December 1997 - September 1998.
