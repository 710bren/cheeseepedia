The first **_Pizza Time Theatre Skee-Ball Points sign**_ was first unraveled at the second Pizza Time Theatre on  placed next to the first appearance of Skee-Ball at a Chuck E. Cheeses Pizza Time Theatre. 

## Production ##
Similar to other signs from the era, a specific production date is not known. However, we can assume it was produced between January 1978 - November 1978; that is if it was not produced multiple times pre-1981 remodel.

## Design ##
The only surfaced image we have of the sign does not showcase the full entirety of what was displayed on it, although we can make out that it says in orange text 'EACH TICKET IS WORTH '3 BIG C' POINTS' which hints that 'Big C Points' were used as early as 1978. 

### Featured Merchandise ###
It is unknown if this was specific to Kooser, but a  was displayed to the top left, presumably to showcase the sizes of plush the sign mentions in orange text as 'PRIZES: BIG CHUCK E. CHEESE PLUSH, LITTLE CHUCK E. CHEESE PLUSH.'

Alongside the marketing of the Chuck E. Cheese plush, a 'Mini Derby Bank' was also advertised.
