Chuck E. Cheese's ghost kitchen delivery service which features the Munch's Make Believe Band member [Pasqually]({{< ref "wiki/Pasqually.md" >}}) as the namesake.

<h2> History </h2>
Started in 2020 when all Chuck E. Cheese locations closed for carryout due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As of 2024, this service is still available.

<h2> Controversy </h2>
In 2020 they came under fire for being the same thing as Chuck E. Cheese and lying about their name on services such as Grubhub. They later updated the menu (items already listed) to differ themselves from Chuck E. Cheese's.
