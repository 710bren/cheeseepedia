<p><h2>History</h2></p>
<p>Sparks opened on December 20th, 1979 in the <i>Greenbrae Center</i> with a Portrait Stage.</p>
<p>This was also the first Chuck E. Cheese of any kind to open in the state of Nevada.</p>
<p>However, not much is known about the location other than it housing a Portrait Stage and a Balcony Stage.</p>
<p>The store was then closed in 1984 for unknown reasons (though it may have been underperforming, a reason for many store closures around the same time) after operating for almost 5 years. The show's fate is unknown.</p>
<p>it is unknown which space in the plaza it occupied.</p>
