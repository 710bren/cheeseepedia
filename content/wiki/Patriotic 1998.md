<h2> Trivia </h2>

* This show is very weird as the characters are barely used or seen during this show. The only time footage the characters is used is during John Mellencamp - 'Rock In The USA'
* The only proper segment in this show is Segment 9 with the rest just being roughly a minute long skit introducing the next song.
