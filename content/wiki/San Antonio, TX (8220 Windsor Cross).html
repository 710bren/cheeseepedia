<b><i>8220 Windsor Cross</b></i>, also known as <b><i>Windcrest</b></i> or <b><i>Walzem</b></i>, was a <i>Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre</i> that opened in 1983 (month and day unknown) with a [[Cyberamics Balcony Stage|Balcony Stage]] and closed in December 2005 (day unknown) with a [2-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/2-Stage.html" >}}) and relocated to [[Selma, TX (14565 IH 35 North)|Selma]].

<h2> Stages </h2>
Walzem at first had a [[Cyberamics Balcony Stage|Balcony Stage]]. However, around 1989, the stage would be removed for presumably the first [Chuck E.'s House Facade]({{< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House Facade.html" >}}) stage. By February 1992, the stage would be removed for one of the first 2-Stages ever installed. It remained up until closure, where the bots and props would be auctioned off. Years later, the bots, stage props, and backdrops would be found to be owned by The Magistery of Austin, TX. The show would be retrofitted in 2022<ref>https:<i>www.themagisteryaustin.com/band</ref>, with assistance of The King ETT, into a horse band. The process would be documented on the <i>History Channel</i> show <i>Secret Restoration</i>.<ref>https:</i>www.history.com/shows/secret-restoration/season-1/episode-9</ref>
<h2> History </h2>
In 1983 (month and day unknown), Windcrest's PTT opened to the public. It originally had a Balcony Stage. However, there is basically no documentation on when it was a PTT. In around 1989, they received the 1988 remodel, changing a lot. It involved unifying many counters and rooms, added checkers around the store, added neon signage, changed the exterior, and removed the Balcony Stage for presumably the first Chuck E.'s House Facade. In February 1992, they would receive a minor remodel, which involved removing the C-Stage for a 2-Stage. Around a few years later, possibly 1994-1996, they would receive [[Phase 1 (1994)|Phase 1]], changing every aspect around the store. Also around this time, the cabaret and lounge areas would be removed. In December 2005 (day unknown), after overbearing complaints about fights and the decline in business in the area, they would relocate to Selma, TX. The building would remain vacant until 2015-2016, when they would turn into a high school. As of July 2023, the school remains on the space.
