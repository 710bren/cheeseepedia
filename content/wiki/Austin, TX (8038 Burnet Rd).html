<b><i>Austin, TX (8038 Burnet Rd), Store #936</b></i><ref>https://www.showbizpizza.com/info/documents/cec/cec_focus-2005-10.pdf</ref> was a <i>Showbiz Pizza Place/Chuck E. Cheese</i> that opened on January 28, 1982, as a corporate location with a [[Classic Stage|Rock-Afire Explosion]] and closed on October 29, 2006 with a 3-Stage.
<h2>History</h2>
Austin (Burnet) opened its doors on January 28th, 1982, as the fifth Showbiz Pizza store in Texas and was a corporate-owned location. It opened next to a Kmart that closed somewhere in the 1980's or 1990's. Like many other Showbiz Pizza locations, it had a typical SPP layout as seen in many other stores across the United States and would eventually receive the 1988 remodel years after it would open removing older SPP decor for newer decor, and slight exterior remodel. Unfortunately, hardly any documentation of Austin (Burnet) exists back when it was a Showbiz Pizza. It received the 1988 remodel in 1988-1989 removing SPP decor for newer SPP decor and changing the Billy Bob stage. Austin (Burnet) then underwent Concept Unification in around 1991, converting the Rock-Afire Explosion into Munch's Make-Believe Band and removing all SPP decor for CEC decor, added Blue and White awnings, and the checkers. In the Late 90's, Austin (Burnet) received the Phase 2 remodel removing older 90's decor, adding newer decor, and SkyTubes and Toddler Zone. The Kmart then got turned into a Ross Dress for Less. The store would later close down on October 29, 2006, due to issues with lease, and relocated to [[Austin, TX (10515 North Mopac Expressway)|10515 North Mopac Expressway]]. After their closure, they would remain abandoned for 9 years until around April 2015 when it and Ross were gutted and rebuilt into a Subaru Car Dealership. Currently, as of May 2023, the Subaru Car Dealership is still here.
<h2>Stages</h2>
Originally, Austin (Burnet) featured a Rock-Afire Explosion, as all other Showbiz locations did. Unfortunately, there are some photos but no videos to exist of Austin (Burnet) with the Rock afire, or as a ShowBiz in general. Austin (Burnet) got Concept Unification sometime in 1991. In October 2006, they removed the 3-Stage for their closure.
