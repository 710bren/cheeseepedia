**_4418 Wyoming Blvd**_ also known as 'Wyoming' is a _Pizza Time Theatre/Chuck E. Cheese_ that opened in October 1981 (day unknown) as a franchised _Pizza Time Theatre Place_ with a Balcony Stage which is still open to this day.

It is located in the Montgomery Crossing shopping center. It is also the only PTT in the state of New Mexico.

##History##
Albuquerque (Wyoming) opened its doors in October 1981 with a Balcony Stage show and was originally a franchised-owned store. Unfortunately, very little documentation exists back in the Pizza Time Theatre era. Like many other Pizza Time Theatre locations, it had the typical PTT layout seen in many other stores across the United States. In the Late 80's, they removed the Balcony Stage for the Chuck E.'s House Facade stage. In the Early 90's, Albuquerque (Wyoming) received the 1988 remodel (Phase 2) and received a new exterior, removed all PTT decor for newer decor, and an exterior change. Around the Late 90's, Albuquerque (Wyoming) received the Phase 3 remodel which removed some early 90's decor and added new decor, SkyTubes and also an exterior change. On August 16th, 1999, the location was sold to the corporate. Albuquerque (Wyoming) remained this way until sometime in 2007-2008 when they received the 2005 Remodel (Phase 4) which involved removing the Showroom Walls, balcony Seating, received a major exterior change, and also removing some older 90's decor and relocating the stage. In 2017, the exterior received a paint job. Albuquerque (Wyoming) would remain like this until September 2022 when they received 2.0 and removed the 2-Stage for the Dance Floor and Video Wall. As of January 2023, they still have the 2.0 Remodel and the Dance Floor.
