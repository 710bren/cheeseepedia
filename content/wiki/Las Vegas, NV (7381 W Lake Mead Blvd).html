<p><h2> History </h2></p>
<p>Lake Mead opened on December 31, 1998 with the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Phase 2 (1997)" >}}">Phase 2</a> remodel, which included late 90s decor, <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Skytubes" >}}">Skytubes</a>, and the Studio C (1997)|Studio C Alpha stage. Lake Mead remained like this for many years until the late 2000s, when they remodeled the interior to the 2005 update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative, which involved removing most 90s decor for new decor, removed the showroom walls and balcony seating, added purple walls, and other minor changes. In March 2022, Lake Mead began the 2.0 remodel, removing the Alpha by April 1. As of July 2023, Lake Mead remains like this.</p>
