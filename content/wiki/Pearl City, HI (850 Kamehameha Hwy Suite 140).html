<p><b><i>850 Kamehameha Hwy Suite 140, Store #3194</b></i> is a Chuck E. Cheese's location in Pearl City, Hawaii. It is located in an unnamed shopping center.</p>
<p>This is not to be confused with the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Pearl City, HI (98-1258 Kaahumanu St)" >}}">Pearl City, HI (98-1258 Kaahumanu St)</a> Pizza Time Theatre which opened on August 7th, 1982 and closed in 1989 with a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage" >}}">Balcony Stage</a>.</p>
<p><h2> Stages </h2></p>
<p>When Pearl City opened, they would receive a 1-Stage with a Turntable. This was the first Cyberamic Stage in Hawaii after the closure of <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Pearl City, HI (98-1258 Kaahumanu St)" >}}">the original location</a> which had the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage" >}}">Balcony Stage</a>. Back when they first opened, Chuck E would have his Tuxedo & Derby outfit like every other Munch's Make Believe Band stage had at the time. In around the Early-Mid 2000's, The Tuxedo & Derby outfit were replaced with the Cool Chuck outfit which he had until his removal. Sometime in the 2000s, the turntable curtain that Chuck E used was changed from blue to red. Then at some point after that, The turntable design was changed to a black background with a star on it. At an unknown point in time, the Wink was removed for 3 Flatscreen TVs. In September 2013, Chuck's cap was removed. Sometime around mid-2016, The turntable was turned, and the background was replaced with a Flatscreen TV, removing the Chuck E animatronic. In October 2021, Munch would receive a custom DJ Munch outfit. As of March 2023, Pearl City still has the 1-Stage but without Chuck E.</p>
<p><h3> Custom Live Shows </h3></p>
<p>Pearl City at one time used their own custom live shows that featured the walkaround characters dancing to popular meme songs such as 'Watch Me 'Whip/Nae Nae', a remix of the <i>Little Einsteins</i> theme song, 'Old Town Road', 'Hit the Quan,' and ending with the Avenger Chuck cover of Party Rock Anthem. These live shows were unauthorized by CEC Entertainment and as a result the store reverted to playing the standard live shows some time around 2020.</p>
