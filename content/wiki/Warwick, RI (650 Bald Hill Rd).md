**650 Bald Hill Rd** is a Chuck E. Cheese's in Warwick, Rhode Island; In the Midland Commons Shopping Center as a freestanding building. It opened on March 6, 2000 with a [Studio C Alpha]({{< ref "wiki/Studio C Alpha.md" >}}). 

##History##
The location opened March 6, 2000 as the first in Rhode Island since the closure of [Warwick, RI (1245 Bald Hill Rd)]({{< ref "wiki/Warwick, RI (1245 Bald Hill Rd).md" >}}) (Which had a 1-Stage) on November 19, 1994 with a Studio C Alpha. This is the first location in New England. 

In Spring 2011, They replaced the Late Night Tuxedo with the Avenger outfit and removed Chuck's cap in September 2013. In around 2014, the curtains were disabled.

The location remodeled to the 2005 Remodel in November 2012 as the last New England location to get the remodel after [Lowell, MA (199 Plain St)]({{< ref "wiki/Lowell, MA (199 Plain St).md" >}}) got it in August 2012. This included the removal of the interactive console & Bluescreen for the Ticket Blaster background which they still have to this day.

Warwick was one of the five New England locations that was open after 2006 that did not receive the Cool Chuck outfit. Those other four were [Newington, CT (3075 Berlin Tpke)]({{< ref "wiki/Newington, CT (3075 Berlin Tpke).md" >}}), [North Dartmouth, MA (412-418 State Rd)]({{< ref "wiki/North Dartmouth, MA (412-418 State Rd).md" >}}), [Waterbury, CT (650 Wolcott St)]({{< ref "wiki/Waterbury, CT (650 Wolcott St).md" >}}), & [Attleboro, MA (287 Washington St)]({{< ref "wiki/Attleboro, MA (287 Washington St).md" >}}).

It's also one of the last locations to have the rubber eyelashes.

This was also the only Studio C in New England not to receive the Cool Chuck outfit.
