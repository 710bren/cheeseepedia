The <b><i>Pizza Time Theatre Showtape</b></i> was the first ever {{< wiki-link "Pizza Time Theatre" >}} showtape to be made, premiering with the opening of the {{< wiki-link "San Jose, CA (370 S Winchester Blvd)" >}} location on May 17, 1977.
The showtape debuted the original <i>Pizza Time Players</i>, including the short-lived <i>Crusty the Cat.</i>
<h2> Production </h2>
<h3> D2 Tape Recording </h3>
At some point after the original showtape was produced, the original audio of the recording sessions, alongside edited and final audio, would be copied to D2 tape, which is the only currently known surviving record that the showtape existed.
The segments on the tape included the original voice demos for the showtape, along with original recordings of songs in the showtape. The demo voice tracks has John Widelock as most of the characters, with Scott Paulin making a small appearence as Jasper in the theme song, and the Warblettes being voiced by Buffy Sainte-Marie. These tracks include:<sup>(1)</sup><ul><li>Bye Bye Blackbird</li><li>The Can-Can</li><li>Cocktails For Two</li><li>How Much is that Doggie in the Window</li><li>Pasqually Show</li><li>Introducing the Pizza Time Orchestra</li><li>PTT Theme Song' (Demo Version)</li><li>The Drive In</li><li>Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy' (Andrews Sisters)</li></ul>
The original artist recordings also feature:<ul><li>Early Bird (Eagles)</li><li>Grandma's Feather Bed (John Denver)</li><li>I Am Woman (Helen Reddy)</li><li>On Top of Spaghetti (Tom Glazer)</li><li>Wabash Cannonball (Lester Flatt / Earl Scruggs)</li></ul>
Finally the tape includes the showtape segments. It is unclear if these segments were all from the original tape, or spread out across multiple unknown tapes from the late 70's. Some tracks are also edited versions, which feature cuts, updates, and raw music tracks.<ul><li>Roots in the Country (Original) Full Version</li><li>Roots in the Country (Original) Shortened Intro</li><li>Endlessly Awake, Part 1</li><li>Crusty's Impressions</li><li>Crusty's Impressions (Edited w/ Original Artists Audio)</li><li>Flag Wavers Medley (I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy / Dixie / California Here I Come / Grand Old Flag)</li><li>Flag Wavers Medley (Raw Unedited Music Tracks)</li><li>Crusty Jukebox Skit (Rock Around the Clock)</li><li>PTT Theme (Updated)</li></ul>
<h2>Segments</h2>
The showtape's segments and order isn't entirely clear, though a copyright record<sup>(2)</sup> confirms a few of the tracks were certainly on the tape:<ul><li>Chuck E. Cheese's Theme</li><li>How Will I Know?</li><li>Roots in the Country</li><li>Endlessly Awake, Part 1</li></ul>
Other segments from the D2 tape may have appeared on the showtape.
