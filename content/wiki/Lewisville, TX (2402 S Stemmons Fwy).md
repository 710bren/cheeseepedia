<b><i>2402 S Stemmons Fwy, Store #35</b></i> was a <i>Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza</i> that opened on October 27, 1992 with a [2-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/2-Stage.md" >}}) and is still open today with the 2.0 remodel. This location is widely known as the smallest corporate owned store. 

<h2> Stages </h2>
This store opened with a smaller than usual [2-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/2-Stage.md" >}}) that was placed in the corner of the showroom. This stage appeared to have in modified for the modular like store, as Pasqually's entire wall was missing and the characters having been moved closer together.

In around 2004 the store received a Small-Town Studio C during its remodel. The showroom would be relocated near the entrance, the former showroom would become the new skills area. This stage in particular was unquie as it had various pieces of the stage covered in reflective material, even having mirrors above the blue-screen area. This also would be the first location to utilize Chuck E.'s backdrop from Studio C 2000 on the small-town set up.

In the beginning months of 2022, during its 2017 2.0 Remodel Program ('2.0' remodel), Studio C was entirely removed and was placed inside a shipping container, likely to be sent to a different store or sent to SPT Distribution for parts. The showroom was relocated once again to the opposite side of the building of where it was prior, and now has the 2021 Chuck E. Live Stage (Dance Floor) (Dance Floor) and [Video Wall]({{< ref "wiki/Video Wall.md" >}}).

<h2> History </h2>
The <i>2402 S Stemmons Fwy</i> Chuck E. Cheese's opened as a free-standing small-town location on October 27, 1992. The location's design was a midway point between the 1986 SPT Remodel Program (1986) and 1990s Major Remodel (1990s stylings) this would be one of many locations, likely the second ever, to be designed by BWM Texas. 

This location would also include prototype showroom artwork of the Chuck E. Cheese characters, unofficially dubbed <i>storybook</i> <i>posters</i>. The artwork would be removed during the 2004 remodel and likely sent to the Support Center in Irving, TX shortly after, as photos from 2015 show most of the artwork seen at the location, although missing pieces. 

In 2020, the location removed the [SkyTubes]({{< ref "wiki/Skytubes.md" >}}), likely due to the COVID19 pandemic.

<h2>= Remodels </h2>=
This Chuck E. Cheese's remodeled for the first time in 2004 during the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative (2003 remodel initiative). This store would be one of the few stores to have multi-colored booths. In 2022 the store remodeled once again during the new 2017 2.0 Remodel Program (2.0 initiative).
