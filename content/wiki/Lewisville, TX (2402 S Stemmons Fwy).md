**_2402 S Stemmons Fwy**_ is a _Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza_ that opened on October 27, 1992 with a [2-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/2-Stage.md" >}}) and is still open today with the 2.0 remodel. This store is known as the smallest corporate store. 

## Stages ##
Lewisville opened with a [2-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/2-Stage.md" >}}). They may have received the Cool Chuck outfit at one point, but we don't know for sure. Around 2004, the stage was removed for a Small-Town Studio C (Studio C Cappa) with curtains, but this specific stage is unofficially known as a _Beta/Cappa Mix_. Around February 2022, the stage was removed for a 2021 Model Chuck E. Live Stage (Dance Floor) (Dance Floor) and [Video Wall]({{< ref "wiki/Video Wall.md" >}}).

## History ##
Lewisville opened on October 27, 1992 with a [2-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/2-Stage.md" >}}) and the 1986 SPT Remodel Program (1988 remodel). According to footage, this location once had storybook posters in the showroom. Around the mid-90s, they received [Phase 1]({{< ref "wiki/Phase 1 (1994).md" >}}), which involved removing all 1988 remodel elements, and changed the exterior. They later received [Phase 2]({{< ref "wiki/Phase 2 (1997).md" >}}) and [Phase 3]({{< ref "wiki/Phase 3 (2000).md" >}}) at later dates, involving the removal of the ball pit for [Skytubes]({{< ref "wiki/Skytubes.md" >}}). In 2004, this location was one of many in Texas to undergo the 2003 update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative, which involved removing all 90s decor for new decor, removing the showroom walls and balcony seating, relocating the showroom, changed the exterior again, and removed the 2-Stage for a Small-Town Studio C (Studio C Cappa), unofficially known as a _Studio C Beta/Cappa Mix_. The Skytubes were removed in 2020. In February 2022, the location received the 2.0 remodel, removing the Cappa for a 2021 Model Chuck E. Live Stage (Dance Floor) (Dance Floor) and Video Wall. The grand reopening was on May 7, 2022. As of August 2023, Lewisville remains like this.
