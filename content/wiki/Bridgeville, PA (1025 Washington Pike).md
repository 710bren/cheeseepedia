<h2>History</h2>
Bridgeville opened its doors on February 17th, 1983, with a Balcony Stage. It was originally a franchise-owned Pizza Time Theatre location owned by the McKinght Family Fun Corporation. In 1989/1990, Bridgeville would receive the 1988 remodel and removed older decor for newer decor, an exterior change, and the removal of the Balcony Stage for Chuck E.'s House Facade. In 1992, Bridgeville would receive a minor remodel, this time another change to the exterior, older decor removed for newer ones, and Chuck E.'s House Facade being removed for the 2-Stage. In the 1998, they would receive yet another remodel, which changed the exterior again, and added SkyTubes. Bridgeville remained like this until 2002 when they relocated. After they relocated, Bridgeville was abandoned for a year or two until they became a pet store, but it was short lived as it closed somewhere between 2015. After the pet store was abandoned, it became a Fine Wine & Good Sprits in 2017. As of September 2023, Fine Wine & Good Sprits is still in the space.
<h2>Stages</h2>
When Bridgeville opened, it housed a Balcony Stage like the other Pizza Time Theatres that opened at the time. Unfortunately, there are not many videos and no photos to exist of Bridgeville back then. Sometime between the Late 80's, they installed Chuck E.'s House Facade (Chuck E.â€™s House Facade), otherwise known as the C-Stage. This location would get a 2-Stage installed in 1992.

In 2002, Bridgeville relocated to their current location which destroyed their 2-Stage.
