<b><i>Johnson City, TN (3100 Bristol Hwy)</b></i> was a Showbiz Pizza Place that opened in January 1986 with a Rock-Afire Explosion and closed in 2001 with the 3-Stage.

This is not to be confused with Johnson City, TN (3020 Peoples St) which opened on March 17th, 2005, with a [Studio C Cappa]({{< ref "wiki/Studio C Cappa.html" >}}) and currently has the 2.0 Remodel.

<h2> History</h2>

<h2>Stages</h2>
Originally when the store opened, they had a Rock-Afire Explosion, as all other Showbiz locations did. They would have it for a few years, until around 1991-1992, when they would undergo Concept Unification, this was the process used to turn the RAE into the CEC characters. In the Mid 1990's Chuck's mask was replaced with a newer one. The store would remain this way until closure.
