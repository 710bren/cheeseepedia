<h2>Trivia:</h2>
* All of the songs in this show are from previous CEC showtapes with some lyrics changed to better fit The King. 'Party Place' and 'Baseball Diamond Dreams' are from <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Spring Break" >}}">Spring Break</a>, 'Chuck E. Shuffle' was originally a Chuck E. Shuffle |live show, 'Go Chuck E. Go' is from <a href="{{< ref "wiki/January 1995" >}}">January 1995</a> and 'I Won't Give Up' is from <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Don't Stop Thinking About Tomorrow" >}}">Don't Stop Thinking About Tomorrow</a>.
* This showtape is one of the last to be released as a reel-to-reel tape. A majority of locations had already converted to SVHS format for Cyberamic shows.
* As this is the last cabaret showtape, it is likely that stores were instructed to play this tape until further notice. As a result, this show would continue for several months up until all Cabaret acts were removed from locations.
