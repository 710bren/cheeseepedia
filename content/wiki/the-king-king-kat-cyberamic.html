The King / King Kat was a 9-foot-tall animatronic, being a parody of Elvis Presley debuted at the Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theater, The King was known to wear a white jumpsuit with silver lining and held a red guitar. His left foot is known to tap to the beat of the music as his mouth moved, swiveling his hips to look around, head down tilting. Programmed to sing some of the original Presley songs. He was able to make dedications of songs to the members of the Pizza Time Theater and also able to tell the audience to visit the main dining area, take a walk through the "fantasy forest" or enjoy some pizza! Even after his end at the Pizza Time Theater, some restaurants had The King until 1995 singing the original CEC songs.

The King as been found in a cameo in a music video for "Every Boy Every Girl 2017" and again in 2018 in the animated short "Halloween at the Pizza Time Theatre", alongside Dolli Dimples and Madame Oink.

King Kat version of The King was a Michael Jackson themed character and sang his songs using the original recordings of Jackson, dawning sunglasses, a curly Afro, a red-sequined jacket, a sequined glove, and held a microphone. His sunglasses are made completely from styrofoam, making his eyes not visible. During his existence, the Pizza Time Theater hoped he would be a success during the company's time of bankruptcy. PTT went bankrupt and got merged with Showbiz Pizza Place, making King Kat have a short existence time with only few units created and installed at locations. A King Kat vest was found at Smitty's but was sold to Volo Auto Museum. You can now find him on display along with The King
