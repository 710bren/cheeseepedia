<b><i>1143 Highland Ave</b></i> is a <i>Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre</i> that opened in May 1982 with a [[Cyberamics Balcony Stage|Balcony Stage]] and is still open today with a Dance floor.

<h2> Stages </h2>
National City opened with a [[Cyberamics Balcony Stage|Balcony Stage]]. Unfortunately, there is no information on it during the PTT era. In 1989/1990, the [[Cyberamics Balcony Stage|Balcony Stage]] was removed for [Chuck E.'s House Facade]({{< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House Facade.html" >}}). In around 1994, [Chuck E.'s House Facade]({{< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House Facade.html" >}}) was removed for the [2-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/2-Stage.html" >}}). The stage went through minor renovations until 2011, when it got converted into a [1-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/1-Stage.html" >}}). In November 2023, the 1-Stage was removed for the Dance Floor and Video Wall.

<h2> History </h2>
National City opened in May 1982 with a [[Cyberamics Balcony Stage|Balcony Stage]]. Although 1 exterior photo exists, there is basically nothing known about National City during the PTT era.

In 1989/1990, National City received the [[SPT 1988 Remodel Program|'80s major remodel]], removing all PTT traces and removed the Balcony Stage for [Chuck E.'s House Facade]({{< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House Facade.html" >}}).

Around 1994, National City received [[Phase 1 (1994)|Phase 1]], removing all 1980s decor and removed [Chuck E.'s House Facade]({{< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House Facade.html" >}}) for a [2-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/2-Stage.html" >}}). They would later receive Phase [[Phase 2 (1997)|2]]/[[Phase 3 (2000)|3]] at later dates.

In 2007/2008, National City received the 2005 update to the [CEC 2005 Remodel Program]({{< ref "wiki/CEC 2005 Remodel Program.html" >}}), removing all 90s decor, removing showroom walls, balcony seating, replaced the lighting, and likely relocated the stage. The store would expand in 2011, converting the [2-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/2-Stage.html" >}}) to a [1-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/1-Stage.html" >}}). National City started the 2.0 remodel in November 2023.
