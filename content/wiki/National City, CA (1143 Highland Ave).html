<h2> Stages </h2>
National City opened with a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage" >}}">Balcony Stage</a>. Unfortunately, there is no information on it during the PTT era. In 1989/1990, the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage" >}}">Balcony Stage</a> was removed for <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House Facade" >}}">Chuck E.'s House Facade</a>. In around 1994, <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House Facade" >}}">Chuck E.'s House Facade</a> was removed for the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/2-Stage" >}}">2-Stage</a>. The bots would eventually be replaced with the ones from <a href="{{< ref "wiki/San Diego, CA (3146 Sports Arena Blvd)" >}}">San Diego, CA (3146 Sports Arena Blvd)</a> in 2004. The stage went through minor cosmetic changes until 2011, when it got converted into a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/1-Stage" >}}">1-Stage</a>. In November 2023, the 1-Stage was removed for the Dance Floor and Video Wall.
<h2> History </h2>
National City opened in May 1982 with a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage" >}}">Balcony Stage</a>. Although 1 exterior photo exists, there is basically nothing known about National City during the PTT era.
In 1989/1990, National City received the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/SPT 1988 Remodel Program" >}}">'80s major remodel</a>, removing all PTT traces and removed the Balcony Stage for <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House Facade" >}}">Chuck E.'s House Facade</a>.
Around 1994, National City received <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Phase 1 (1994)" >}}">Phase 1</a>, removing all 1980s decor and removed <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House Facade" >}}">Chuck E.'s House Facade</a> for a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/2-Stage" >}}">2-Stage</a>. They would later receive Phase <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Phase 2 (1997)" >}}">2</a>/<a href="{{< ref "wiki/Phase 3 (2000)" >}}">3</a> at later dates.
In 2007/2008, National City received the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/CEC 2005 Remodel Program" >}}">CEC 2005 Remodel Program</a>, removing all 90s decor, removing showroom walls, balcony seating, replaced the lighting, and likely relocated the stage. The store would expand in 2011, converting the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/2-Stage" >}}">2-Stage</a> to a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/1-Stage" >}}">1-Stage</a>. National City started the 2.0 remodel in November 2023.
