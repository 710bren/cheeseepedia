**_2333-A Forest Dr, Store #50**_ is a Chuck E. Cheese in Annapolis, Maryland; in the Festival at Riva Shopping Center. 

##History##
Annapolis opened on April 10th, 1993 at the Festival at Riva Shopping Center with a [2-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/2-Stage.md" >}}){< ref "wiki/2-Stage.md" >}}). The store would receive it's first remodel around the Mid-Late 1990's which included the removal of the Ball Crawl for the SkyTubes and the changing of the exterior logo (The letters were surprisingly white instead of Red and Yellow). Annapolis would remain this way until 2011 when they would receive the 2010 Update to the [2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative]({{< ref "wiki/2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration  Major Remodel Initiative.md" >}}) removing the Showroom walls, Balcony Seating, redoing the Ordering Counter, Salad Bar, reconfiguring the Kid Check area, and remodeling the exterior (As well as changing the color of the letters from white to red). As of March 2023, Annapolis still has the 2-Stage and 2010 Update.  

## Stages ##
When Annapolis first opened, they received a 2-Stage. This is one of the few 2-Stages that doesn't have Pasqually's Brick Wall onstage. By 2000, the side to side curtains were replaced with Up and Down curtains. This is one of the few stores that opened after 2006 not to ever have the Cool Chuck outfit. By 2009, the Tuxedo & Derby was replaced with the Avenger outfit. In the Early-Mid 2010's, Pasqually's drumhead was changed from the Orange Swirl from when they opened to the Explosion Drumhead they still have to this day. In September 2013, Chuck's Avenger Cap was removed. As of March 2023, Annapolis still has their 2-Stage.
