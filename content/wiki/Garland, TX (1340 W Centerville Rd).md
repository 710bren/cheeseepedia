**_1340 W Centerville Rd**_ also known as 'Centerville' is a _Showbiz Pizza/Chuck E. Cheese_ that opened on November 3, 1982 as a corporate _ShowBiz Pizza Place_ with a [https://chuckepedia.com/wiki/Classic_Stage Rock-Afire Explosion].
##History##
Garland opened its doors on November 3rd, 1982 with a Rock-afire Explosion show. It was originally and currently a corporate-owned store. Like many other ShowBiz Pizza locations, it had a typical SPP layout seen in many other stores across the United States and would eventually receive the 1988 remodel years after it would open. Although very little documentation exists back in the ShowBiz days, it can be determined that Garland was one of several locations to receive an Uncle Klunk show package (and a Santa Claus retrofit package as well) sometime after opening. Like many ShowBiz locations in the late 1980s, Garland received the Showbiz Pizza Campground upgrade.

In around 1991/1992, Englewood received Concept Unification which converted the show to Munch's Make Believe Band. In around the Mid-Late 1990's, Garland received either [https://chuckepedia.com/wiki/Phase_1_(1994) Phase 1] or [https://chuckepedia.com/wiki/Phase_2_(1997) Phase 2] remodel which removed some early 90's decor and added new decor and SkyTubes. In the early 2000's, Englewood received the Phase 3 remodel which removed the 3-Stage for the Studio C Alpha. Englewood remained this way until sometime in 2008 when they received the 2005 Remodel which involved removing the Showroom Walls, balcony Seating, received a new exterior, expanding the store, and also removing some older 90's decor. In October 2022, they received the 2.0 remodel removing the Alpha for the Dance Floor. They were formerly the last non 2.0 store in Colorado but as of January 2023, they still have the 2.0 remodel and dance floor and Colorado is officially considered 'bot-less'.
##Stages##
Garland opened with the Rock afire Explosion in July 1981. Unfortunately, there are some photos but no videos to exist of Englewood with the Rock afire, or as a ShowBiz in general.

In 1991/1992, Garland received [https://chuckepedia.com/wiki/Concept_Unification Concept Unification], converting the Rock afire into Munchâ€™s Make Believe Band.

In the early 2000's, Garland removed the 3-Stage for the Studio C Alpha stage.

In November 2021, the location received the 2.0 remodel removing the Alpha stage for the Dance Floor.
