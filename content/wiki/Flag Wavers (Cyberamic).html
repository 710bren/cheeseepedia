The Flag Wavers were prop animatronics installed in Pizza Time Theatre locations throughout the 1980s, generally found on the [[Cyberamics Portrait / Shelf Stage|Portrait / Shelf Stage]] and [[Cyberamics Balcony Stage|Balcony Stage.]] Throughout the 1980s, they would be largely produced by Riordan Co., who would also manufacture [[Jasper T. Jowls (Cyberamic)|Jasper]]'s banjo, and a later version of Artie Antlers' antlers. They would occasionally be found around the [[Chuck E.'s House|Rocker Stage]], [[Chuck E.'s House Facade|C-Stage]] and on a couple [[San Antonio, TX (8220 Windsor Cross)|2-]][[Anchorage, AK (308 E Northern Lights Blvd)|Stages]], too, as leftovers from the previously stated stages. The last location to have flags was the [Simi Valley, CA (71 Tierra Rejada Rd)]({{< ref "wiki/Simi Valley, CA (71 Tierra Rejada Rd).html" >}}) location, which closed in May 2008.
