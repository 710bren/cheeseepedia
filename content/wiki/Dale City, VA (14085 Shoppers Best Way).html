<p><h2> History </h2></p>
<p>Dale City opened on February 15th, 1993, with a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/2-Stage" >}}">2-Stage</a>. The store would be remodeled a few times, until March of 2018, when there was a fire outside the building that damaged the building, forcing them to receive the 2.0 remodel. As of March 2023, the store still has the 2.0 remodel.</p>
<p><h2> Stages </h2></p>
<p>The store opened with a 2-Stage. They kept their 2-Stage up until March 2018 when an exterior fire damaged the store badly which made them start their 2.0 remodel which lasted roughly 7 months. The 2.0 remodel added the Pizzeria and Games logo, Play Pass machines, removal of <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Skytubes" >}}">Skytubes</a> and stage, and a nicer interior. Dale City was the last Cyberamic store in northern Virginia and the third to last in the state; this was also the last 2-Stage in Virginia that didn't come from a closed store. The final MMBB stage in Virginia was <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Chesapeake, VA (1528 Sam's Circle)" >}}">Chesapeake, VA (1528 Sam's Circle)</a> which used animatronics from the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Merced, CA (721 W Olive Ave)" >}}">Merced</a> location that closed in 1995.</p>
