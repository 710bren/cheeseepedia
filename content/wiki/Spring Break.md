## Trivia ##

* This is the first CEC showtape where Disney was completely involved with the showtape's production.
** Looking closely at 'Party Place' in particular, you can see it was filmed at Disney-MGM Studios' Streets of America, Bay Lake, Disney's Fort Wilderness Campgrounds and the mascots on stage scenes were likely filmed at Disney Village's Pleasure Island.
