In 1989/1990, the location received the 1988 remodel, removing all PTT decor, added checkers around the store, changed the exterior, and removed the Balcony Stage for [Chuck E.'s House Facade]({{< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House Facade.md" >}}). It is unknown if this location ever received a [1-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/1-Stage.md" >}}). Riverside remained like this until April 1996 (day unknown), when they would close permanently. The building was later split up into multiple businesses, all still reside today.
