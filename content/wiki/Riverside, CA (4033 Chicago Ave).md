<b><i>4033 Chicago Ave</b></i> was a <i>Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre</i> that opened in 1981/1982 (date unknown) with a [Balcony Stage]({{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage.md" >}}) and closed in April 1996 (day unknown) with either a [1-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/1-Stage.md" >}}) or [Chuck E.'s House Facade]({{< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House Facade.md" >}}).

This is not to be confused with the short-lived [Riverside, CA (10121 Hole Ave)]({{< ref "wiki/Riverside, CA (10121 Hole Ave).md" >}}), which opened around the same time and closed in 1984 (month and day unknown with a [Balcony Stage]({{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage.md" >}}).

<h2> Stages </h2>
Riverside at first had a [Balcony Stage]({{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage.md" >}}). Around 1989/1990, it was replaced with a [Chuck E.'s House Facade]({{< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House Facade.md" >}}). It is rumored that it had a [1-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/1-Stage.md" >}}), but this is currently unconfirmed. After closure, their bots were sent to Sandy, UT (10535 So. State St) (Sandy, UT) for their grand opening, and after closure, the bots were used for parts at [Orem]({{< ref "wiki/Orem, UT (40 E Center St).md" >}}). After the 2017 closure of Orem, the fate of the Cyberamics is unknown.

<h2> History </h2>
Riverside opened in 1981/1982 with a [Balcony Stage]({{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage.md" >}}) and was in an unnamed shopping center. Unfortunately, info on Riverside in general is scarce. In 1989/1990, the location received the 1988 remodel, removing all PTT decor, added checkers around the store, changed the exterior, and removed the Balcony Stage for [Chuck E.'s House Facade]({{< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House Facade.md" >}}). In 1994, Riverside would be remodeled to the 1992 remodel with Phase 3, possibly removing the C Stage and possibly adding SkyTubes, and Kid Check. This remodel also removed the waving flags and 1988 decor. It is unknown if this location ever received a [1-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/1-Stage.md" >}}). Riverside remained like this until April 1996 (day unknown), when they would close permanently. The building was later split up into multiple businesses, all still reside today.
