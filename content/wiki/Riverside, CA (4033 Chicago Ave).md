**_4033 Chicago Ave**_ was a _Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre_ that opened in 1981/1982 (date unknown) with a [\2](\1) and closed in April 1996 (day unknown) with either a [[1-Stage]] or [[Chuck E.'s House Facade]].

This is not to be confused with the short-lived [\2](\1).

##  Stages ## 
Riverside at first had a [\2](\1). Around 1989/1990, it was replaced with a [\2](\1) for their grand opening, and after closure, the bots were used for parts at [\2](\1). After the 2017 closure of Orem, the fate of the Cyberamics are unknown.

##  History ## 
Riverside opened in 1981/1982 with a [\2](\1) and was in an unnamed shopping center. Unfortunately, info on Riverside in general is scarce. In 1989/1990, the location received the 1988 remodel, removing all PTT decor, added checkers around the store, changed the exterior, and removed the Balcony Stage for [[Chuck E.'s House Facade]]. It is unknown if this location ever received a [[1-Stage]]. Riverside remained like this until April 1996 (day unknown), when they would close permanently. The building was later split up into multiple businesses, all still reside today.
