It would be a mix of live and pre recorded audio with the costumes preforming various CEC Songs. With someone named Jessi being an actor on the stage who spoke to Chuck and his gang (minus Pasqually)

##  Summary: ## 
With the help of Jessi & Chuck E.'s Crew (Minus Pasqually) they're able to put on a show to entertain the guests using a mix of live shows and normal shows. After the show is over they would play various a mix of live show songs such as 'Happy & U Know It' and licensed songs such as 'Watch Me (Whip/Nae Nae)'.

##  Trivia: ## 
Play All You Can Play replaces Chucks vocals with helens during his 'Solo' and then replaces Munch's vocals with Helens during his 'Solo'

Dog Days of Summer removes the rest of backing vocals and has sing be the only backup singer and also sings some of Jaspers lines. 

Chuck E. Cheese's Birthday Song rerecorded all the backing vocals meaning you can now hear Helen, Jasper and DJ Munch clearly now

Happy Birthday (Spanish) was rerecorded with the US voice actors. 

Song of Summer (Concert Remix) has Jessi sing Bella's lines and also ends the song after they all sing 'Sing a song of summer with me' to fade into them saying their goodbyes.
