His head is round and has a big gaping mouth with a large tongue and a set of three sharp felt teeth. On his snout he has two yellow nostrils. His eyes are black plastic pieces with white printing for the white in his eyes and orange for his eyelids. His eyebrows are two yellow felt pieces and he has long fuzzy yellow hair.

###Differences Between Smaller Size###
There aren't many differences between this plush and it's  except for the glaring difference in the size of the plastic eyes. The eyes are significantly better looking on this plush compared to it's smaller size. Also the build of the plush is noticeably different between the two.

Comparing it to the plush's , on the other hand, is much harder. They're very close in design. It really all comes down to the build of the plush. The 20' plush has more prominent shoulders, and its left hand on its belly instead of it's waist.
