<p><h2> History</h2></p>
<p>St. Petersburg opened its doors in March 1983 with a Balcony Stage. Being one of the few that survived the bankruptcy, it was originally a franchised-owned Pizza Time Theatre location until corporate bought the location one October 22, 1984, along with many other locations. Like all locations at some point, St. Petersburg received the 1988 Remodel in 1988-1989 which involved the removal of the Balcony Stage for Chuck E.'s House Facade or the C-Stage, PTT decor being removed for CU and other decor, addition of the Blue and White awnings above the salad bar, & checkers around and outside the store. In around 1995-1996, St. Petersburg received Phase 1 removing CU decor for the Record Posters, the removal of the Chuck E.'s House Facade for the 2-Stage, the removal of the Blue and White awnings above the salad bar, a major exterior change, and the Cabaret (Lounge) room and the King were removed for more games. In the Late 90's, St. Petersburg received the Phase 2 remodel removing some decor for newer decor, updated the salad bar, received another exterior change, and SkyTubes.</p>
<p>In 2005-2006, St. Petersburg received the 2005 Remodel which involved the removal the Showroom Walls, Balcony Seating, removed older decor for newer decor, the removal of all 1988 remodel checkers, expanded the store, received another exterior change, and removing the 2-Stage for the Studio C Beta and also relocating the stage.</p>
<p>Around 2020 or 2021, St. Petersburg's front exterior sign was replaced with the 2.0 logo sign because it was suffering from old age.</p>
<p>In December 2022, the location officially remodeled again to CEC's 2.0 remodel removing the Beta for the Dance Floor and Video Wall.</p>
