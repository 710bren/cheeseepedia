##History##
Chattanooga opened on October 19th, 1982 as the 4th ShowBiz Pizza store in Tennessee (4th after [Madison]({{< ref "wiki/Madison, TN (2070 Gallatin Pike).md" >}}), [Knoxville]({{< ref "wiki/Knoxville, TN (7522 Kingston Pike).md" >}}), & [Memphis Hickory Hill]({{< ref "wiki/Memphis, TN (3649 Hickory Hill Rd).md" >}})) with a Rock-afire Explosion show. It was originally a franchised-owned store. They would later end up receiving the CEC 1988 Remodel (1988 Remodel) removing the old Showbiz decor, and adding newer decor. In 1991, Chattanooga received Concept Unification which removed the Rock-Afire for the 3-Stage and removed all Showbiz decor, added new decor, and a change to the exterior. Chattanooga was then bought by the corporate on September 16, 1996 along with 18 other locations. Chattanooga underwent another remodel in the Mid 90's which involved the removal of the Neon Signage, Blue and White Awnings, some checkers around the store and another exterior change. In 2000 or 2001, Chattanooga received the Phase 3 remodel removing older decor, adding newer decor, and SkyTubes. In 2006-2007, Chattanooga received the CEC 2005 Remodel (2005 Remodel) which removed all 1990's store art, Balcony Seating, Showroom Walls, another change to the exterior, adding purple walls, & the 3-Stage was removed for the Studio C Beta. Their road sign was actually interesting as the Phase 3 sign had Chuck E. in a different pose and had the Showbiz Pizza sign mold were kept from their 2000 or 2001 remodel and opening until 2013-2014 when the sign was changed to the Phase 4 sign. In September 2019, Chattanooga received the 2.0 remodel which removed the Beta for the Dance Floor. The store's Grand Reopening would occur in around December 2019. As of July 2024, Chattanooga still has the 2.0 Remodel and Dance Floor with the Video Wall.
