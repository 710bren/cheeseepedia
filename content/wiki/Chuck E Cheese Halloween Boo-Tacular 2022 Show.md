##Trivia:##

*'Gotta Be Halloween' and 'Halloween Night' are originally from Chuck E. Cheese's Show 4 2021 (Studio C) (Show 4 2021) and 'Pumpkin Patch' is originally from Chuck E. Cheese's Show 6 2018 (Show 6 2018). However, the version included here is the 2020 version which dubs over the Chucktober references.

*This show is the first to exclude any character programming signals for Studio SD/HD systems. During this show, the system will default to random movements at all times.

*This is the first show since her debut where Dino Summer's name is said aloud. Previously, she'd only been referred to as such behind the scenes.

*The 'Timecode' Intermission is a clip of 'Witches Crew' playing at different speeds.

*Chuck E. Cheese's Show 4 2021 (Existing Stages) (Chuck E. Cheese Halloween Boo-Tacular Nights) was intended to come back in 2022 (with new content) but due to unknown reasons was cancelled.
*Week of August the 8th they started filming for the Halloween Boo-Tacular 2022 new show content.
*On August 24, 2022 a snippet of one of the new songs was leaked.
*The [Yonkers, NY (1703 Central Park Ave)]({{< ref "wiki/Yonkers, NY (1703 Central Park Ave).md" >}}) location played the show a week early.

*Pumpkins in My Pockets now has programming for Existing Stages. Prior to this, it was only an intermission.

*Munch Jr. is programmed for Howl-O-Ween.

*Despite Studio SD/HD systems no longer being programmed, at the start of each skit the curtains open and at the start of each intermission they close. Along with that, the DVD / Floppy still has files for each song and live with the only signals being random movements.
*The Studio C Release of this show has deleted corporate programming files titled '$01Family.cec', '$01Rockin Robot.cec', '$02Nobody There.cec', '$02Play.cec', '$05Sammy The Skateboarding Skeleton.cec', '$08Be Yourself.cec', '$09Out Of This World.cec', '$10I Didn't Need To Be Afraid.cec', '%70DJ Munch's Glow Party1.cec', '%71DJ Munch's Glow Party2.cec', '%72DJ Munch's Glow Party3.cec', '%73DJ Munch's Glow Party4.cec', '%74DJ Munch's Glow Party5.cec', '%75DJ Munch's Glow Party6.cec', '&20Boo-Tastic Dance.cec', 'Be Youself.cec', 'Be Youself.cec', 'Be Youself.cec', 'Cat Sitting.cec', 'Franken Conga.cec', 'I Don't Need To Be Afraid.cec', and 'Pumpkin Patch.cec'. These files do not have any of the AV Frame data written to the programming when the show is being put on the Floppy Disk and are the original names. Most of these files are also corrupted.
