<h2> Trivia </h2>
*The VJ spots in this show feature Matt Daniel. The VJ spot in Segment 5 is interesting as 'Going On A Diet', a cut song from [September 2004]({{< ref "wiki/September 2004.md" >}}), can be heard in the background.
*Most of the songs in this show use single versions which don't include intro dialogue or the ending applause.
*A Generic Version of Best of 2008 with a different lineup is rumored to exist presumably it is the same lineup with the adverts removed.
