**_10535 S. State St, Store #3203**_ was a franchised _Chuck E. Cheese's_ location that opened in Summer of 1996 with a 1-Stage and closed in 2014.

This location is **not** a relocation of the Sandy, UT (792 E 9400) which was a Pizza Time Theatre location that opened in February 1983 and closed in April 1985.
##Stage##
This location received the Cyberamic characters from the [Riverside, CA]({{< ref "wiki/Riverside, CA (4033 Chicago Ave).md" >}}) location for use on their 1-Stage show. The Cyberamics still utilized a portion of the original cosmetics before removal.

Once the store closed in 2014, the stage was cleared of everything, and a large projector screen was put on the stage. The Cyberamics' parts would then be used at the [Orem]({{< ref "wiki/Orem, UT (40 E Center St).md" >}}) store on their 3-Stage show.

##History##
As this franchised store opened in 1996 in a secluded location, it has gone mostly undocumented besides of things seen in the 2001 home video that would suggest the store opened with [Phase I]({{< ref "wiki/Phase 1 (1994).md" >}}).<ref>https://youtu.be/9AQTyNYsy2w</ref> At some point the store also received [Phase III]({{< ref "wiki/Phase 3 (2000).md" >}}), which most likely is why the [Skytubes]({{< ref "wiki/Skytubes.md" >}}) were relocated between then and 2011.

In September 2011 this location was remodeled for the first time as a Chuck E. Cheese's during the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative ('Cool Chuck' remodel initiative).

### Closure ###
By the Fall of 2014, the location closed and was turned into an expansion of the next-door All-Star Bowling franchise. All of the walls were repainted, and all CEC branding would be removed, although various games would be reused,<ref>https://youtu.be/5HSeQVUvLn4</ref> most notably the [Skytubes]({{< ref "wiki/Skytubes.md" >}}). The Showroom, however, remained, along with the stage (without the bots or props) the artifact shelves, the booths, and the hanging lights.
