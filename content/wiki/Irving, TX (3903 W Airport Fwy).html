<p><h2>History</h2></p>
<p><b><i>3903 W Airport Fwy, Irving, TX</b></i> opened as a Showbiz Pizza on September 27, 1988. In 1991 and 1994, they filmed a collection of training tapes for employees. 1994 is also the year this location remodeled for the first time and received <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Phase 1 (1994)" >}}">Phase I</a> and the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/1-Stage" >}}">1-Stage</a> show concept. Between 1997 and 2000 they expand the skills area for more games and seating.</p>
<p>In 2004 they received an early version of the 'Cool Chuck' remodel. Shortly after in 2006 they tested the 'Token Card' and 'Chuck E-Tickets' system, an alternative way to play games. This would be the predecessor to the Play-Pass and E-Tickets, that would utilize the same concepts as before.</p>
<p>On July 21st, 2006, Cheesevention III would be hosted at the location, along with the now closed <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Richardson, TX (1235 E Belt Line Rd)" >}}">Richardson, TX</a> location.</p>
<p>This location got the prototype <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Ticket Blaster" >}}">Ticket Blaster</a> in 2008, because of its positive reception it was replaced with a finalized version in 2009. Then In 2010, the original street sign was replaced and bought closer towards to building. Around this time, they would also majorly downsize their <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Skytubes" >}}">Skytubes</a> to fit in a smaller area.</p>
<p>On July 23rd, 2011, Cheesevention 8 would be hosted at the location as well.</p>
<p>In 2015 the location received its third remodel, receiving new art, multicolored walls, and a refurbished exterior. Accompanying this was a short-lived area called 'Chuck E. Cheese's Spectacular Boardwalk', a small area that had Milk Jug Toss, 'Gold Fishin', and 'Down the Clown'. This would be its shortest-lived remodel because in 2019 they would remodel into the new '2.0' design then would finally be featured in advertisements from that point forward. The store would then remodel again by the Summer of 2021 to relocate the showroom in favor of installing a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Video Wall" >}}">Video Wall</a> to be used for filming Live Shows up until around early 2023.</p>
