##History##
San Diego/Mira Mesa opened its doors in 1981 or 1982 as a franchised location. Unfortunately, there is not a lot of information of San Diego/Mira Mesa back then. On October 22nd, 1984, the location was sold to corporate along with 50 other locations. In 1988 or 1989, San Diego/Mira Mesa received the 1988 remodel removing all PTT decor, adding CU decor, an exterior change, and the removal of the Balcony Stage for Chuck E.'s House Facade In the early 90's, San Diego/Mira Mesa underwent a minor remodel that removed a little decor for newer decor and the removal of Chuck E.'s House Facade for the 2-Stage. Around the Late 90's, the location received the so-called 'Phase 2' remodel removing older 90's decor, adding newer decor, another exterior change, and SkyTubes. San Diego/Mira Mesa would remain like this until 2006 when they received the 2005 remodel removing the Showroom Walls, Balcony Seating, removing the Late 90's and early 2000's decor for newer decor, a new exterior change, and the relocation of the stage. Currently, as of February 2023, the location still has the 2005 remodel and the 2-Stage.
