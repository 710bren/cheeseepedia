## Trivia: ##

* 'Loppins Boopin Fakin Doopin Floppen Loopen Funnin's Day' is originally from Chuck E. Cheese's Show 1 2018 (Show 1 2018), 'Play All You Can Play' is originally from Chuck E. Cheese's Show 3 2019 (Show 3 2019), and 'Chuck E's Place' is originally from Chuck E. Cheese's Show 3 2017 (Show 3 2017).
* Chuck E.'s Place had its intro cut from the show due to it being related to the 40th Years of Fun promotion. Strangely, the 'Wink' jingle was also kept for Studio C locations despite those locations not having a Wink.
* This show ended up being cut short due to the pandemic on March 17, 2020.
* On March 13, 2020, Automatic Live shows were disabled for Studio C and Weigl systems due to COVID-19.
* The Studio C Release of this show has deleted corporate programming files titled '$01Family.cec', '$01Rockin Robot.cec', '$02Game On.cec', '$02Loppins.cec', '$02Play.cec', '$03Disco Dancing.cec', '$08Play All You Can Play.cec', '$09Out Of This World.cec', and '$30Chuck E's Place.cec'. These files do not have any of the AV Frame data written to the programming when the show is being put on the Floppy Disk and are the original names.
* After this show, there would be a 3 month delay for new shows. Most Chuck E. Cheese's locations had started to close due to safety concerns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, so new shows weren't necessary during the period where most stores were closed.
