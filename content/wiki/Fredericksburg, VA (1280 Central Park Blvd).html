<p>Fredericksburg would stay vacant until June 9th, 2021, when work started on reopening the location. The rebuilding of the location would last 44 days when they did their soft opening on July 23rd, 2021, as <i>Chuck E. Cheese,</i> receiving the 2.0 Remodel and a Dance Floor and Video Wall, A few days in between their soft opening and grand opening they would finish minor changes such as enlarging the Chuck sign next to the video wall to make it look much more organized. They also did some changes to their kitchen. they were the second store to get the 2021 Model and Video Wall in Virginia, as Manassas got the first (and first 2021 Model Dance Floor and Video Wall overall).
