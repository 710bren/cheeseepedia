The **_Winchester Flag Wavers**_ was an animatronic produced by [Fantasy Forest]({{< ref "wiki/Fantasy Forest.md" >}}) for the [Pizza Time Theatre]({{< ref "wiki/Pizza Time Theatre.md" >}}) on [San Jose, Ca (370 S Winchester Blvd)]({{< ref "wiki/San Jose, CA (370 S Winchester Blvd).md" >}}) in May 1977. The Bot was a collection of waving flags that were around the room that were controlled through one animatronic system.

The Bot was used from May 1977 up until either Winchester got [Cyberamics]({{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics.md" >}}) in 1981, or when the location closed in 1985.
