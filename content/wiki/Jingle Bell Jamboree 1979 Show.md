*Chuck E. & Friends - “The Holiday Party” was written by Eric Neal as a request from Matt Daniel. Neal, enjoying old school hip-hop, created the song in a similar vein to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/So_What%27cha_Want 'So What'Cha Want'] by the Beastie Boys.
*Munch & Munch - “The Windowsill” was also written by Matt Daniel as a new Munch song. The song was a nod to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby,_It%27s_Cold_Outside Baby It's Cold Outside], being an idea Matt had, along with an idea for Munch to struggle with his conscience in song, for around for a few years. Someone in the entertainment department eventually came up with theming the song around the holidays, and with a new Munch puppet being created around the same time, Matt went ahead with the creation of the song.
*On the DVD Menu for Munch's Make Believe Band set up it says 'Show 5, 2020' instead of 'Show 5 2021'
*Hidden at the end of the Studio C SD copy of Show 5, 2021 shows a clip of 'Merry Christmastime' slowed down and playing backwards for varying amounts of time. This is ment for Timecode purposes meaning each shows total length will be the same.
*The I-Drive (7419 International Dr, Orlando, FL) store played this 4 days early for its 2.0 remodel opening.
