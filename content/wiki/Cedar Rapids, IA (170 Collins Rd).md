**_170 Collins Rd NE**_ was a Showbiz Pizza Place/Chuck E. Cheese that opened on November 26, 1981 with a Rock-Afire Explosion, which is still open to this day.

This converted to a Chuck E. Cheese in 1992, and closed in November 2013.

It was located across from the Lindale Mall.

It was located next to a Kmart along with other businesses.

##  Stages ## 
Originally when the store opened, they had a Rock-Afire Explosion, as all other Showbiz locations had.

In 1992, Cedar Rapids would undergo Concept Unification, turning the Rock-afire Explosion into Munch's Make Believe Band. It was one of 4 Showbiz Pizzas in Iowa to undergo Concept Unification.

In November 2013, the location closed and the 3-Stage was removed.

This location is the 3rd Showbiz Pizza to open in Iowa and the 40th Showbiz Pizza overall.
## History## 
Cedar Rapids opened on November 26th, 1981 as the 3rd ShowBiz Pizza store in Iowa with the Rock-afire Explosion show and was an expansion of the nearby Kmart which originally opened on November 19th, 1970. In 1988-1989, Cedar Rapids would receive a minor remodel removing the old Showbiz decor, adding some newer decor, and the Billy Bob stage layout being changed. Strangely, the exterior sign was not changed. In 1992, Cedar Rapids received Concept Unification and the 1988 Remodel removing older decor for newer decor, added Blue and White awnings, added checkers, received an exterior and sign change, and converted the Rock-afire Explosion band into the 3-Stage. Cedar Rapids underwent the Phase 2 remodel in the late 90's which involved the removal of the Neon Signage, Blue and White Awnings, and all checkers around the store as well as adding SkyTubes and Toddler Zone. On November 18th, 2013, the location closed because there were numerous issues with the surrounding area. The Kmart then closed in December 2013 and so did all of the other businesses. Cedar Rapids would remain abandoned for a few months until the CEC, Kmart, and the businesses were immediately redeveloped into a Hobby Lobby and a few businesses. Currently, as of May 2023, the Hobby lobby and the businesses are still here.
