**Charlie Cheese's Pizza Playhouse** was the Australian version of Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre. There were two locations, one in , and one in . The name was changed because in Australian English, the word 'Chuck' means to throw up, or vomit. The two locations would never make it out of the 1980's with the second location in Carindale closing between 1984 and 1986, making the Charlie Cheese's Pizza Playhouse name extinct.
