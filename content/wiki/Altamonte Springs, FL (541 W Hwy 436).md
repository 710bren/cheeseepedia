**_541 W Hwy 436**_ was a _ShowBiz Pizza Place_ located in Altamonte Springs, Florida.  It opened in March 1981 and was the fourteenth ShowBiz to ever open (This was also the first ShowBiz to open in the Orlando area & the third to open in Florida following the [Jacksonville]({{< ref "wiki/Jacksonville, FL (9820 Atlantic Blvd).md" >}}) & Tampa, FL (1707 E Fowler Ave) (Tampa) locations). 

## History ##
Altamonte Springs opened its doors on March 25th, 1981 with the RockAfire Explosion like every other ShowBiz did. Like many other ShowBiz locations, it had a typical SPP layout seen in many other stores across the United States and would eventually receive the 1988 remodel years after it would open. 

In the year 1990, Concept Unification was in full swing and Altamonte Springs would be one of five locations to test the concept that year. Then in around the Mid 1990's the store would receive the 1993 remodel sometime by 1995 at the earliest, complete with: an Obstotron (later SkyTubes); 1991 Platinum CD Award posters (Flabby Road, Brawn in the USA, Cheese Z Top, Vitaminology, & Saturday Night Retriever); Mt. Chuckmore poster; 1991 Postcard posters (Pasqually's Italy and Jasper's Wild West); Cheese Guitar sign; 1993 Salad Bar, Beverages and Round Coach Chuck signs; 1991 Confetti Portraits; and other misc signage.

In 1998, Altamonte Springs would remodel once again, this time removing the 3-Stage for a Studio C Alpha; receiving one of the first Studio C stages in Florida. 

In around 2005-2006, Altamonte Springs would remodel to the 2005 remodel; removing most of the 90's decorations (Except for the Round Coach Chuck sign above the ordering counter & the Record Posters), knocking down the Showroom walls, removing the balcony seating, & adding purple walls. Chuck's outfit was replaced with the Cool Chuck outfit not long after that. 

In around 2012, Chuck's outfit was replaced with the Avenger outfit. Chuck's cap would be removed in September 2013. In 2014-2015, the removed the Interactive Console, & Bluescreen Camera. Not long after that, they disabled the curtains. 

In Late 2015-Early 2016, the awnings were removed from the building.
