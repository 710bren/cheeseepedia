## Question for Documentor ##
Hi, Why did my edit get reverted? I don't know why, I think it would be a bit better to include the opening / closing date for the locations since it gets confusing I guess, maybe it just clutters the page? I don't know, please respond as soon as you can. - Thanks, CECBowlingGreen
