<b><i>Spanish Birthday</b></i> is a birthday show included in Madame Oink III - 'Tunnel of Love' Spanish Version. It is a Spanish version of <i>It's Somebody's Birthday Today</i>. The show is identical to the later [Spanish Birthday]({{< ref "wiki/Spanish Birthday.md" >}}) with the only difference being a lack of visual content.
