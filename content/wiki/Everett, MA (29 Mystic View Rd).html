<b><i>29 Mystic View Road #02149</b></i> is a Chuck E. Cheese's which opened on June 19, 2001, with a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Studio C Beta" >}}">Studio C Beta, 32M</a>, which is still open to this day with the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/CEC 2018 20 Remodel Program" >}}">2.0 Remodel</a>. Everett was the only 32M Beta in Massachusetts, as all other Betas in the region were 16M Betas with the exception of <a href="{{< ref "wiki/South Portland, ME (166 Philbrook Ave)" >}}">South Portland, ME</a> and <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Meriden, CT (533 S Broad St)" >}}">Meriden, CT.</a>
This location is likely a relocation of <a href="{{< ref "wiki/West Roxbury, MA (1665 VFW Pkwy)" >}}">West Roxbury, MA (1665 VFW Pkwy)</a>, which closed in June 2001 with a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Road Stage" >}}">Cyberamics Road Stage</a>.
<h2> History </h2>
This location originally opened up with Phase 3 and had the Cool Chuck outfit,  allegedly  the first Studio C location to open with it. before getting the Avenger outfit sometime in the early 2010s. The hat would be removed in September 2013. Then, in November 2014, along with <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Methuen, MA (90 Pleasant Valley Rd)" >}}">Methuen, MA (90 Pleasant Valley Rd)</a>, they would remodel to the 2013 update of <a href="{{< ref "wiki/CEC 2005 Remodel Program" >}}">CEC 2005 Remodel</a>. The bot would receive the Rockstar outfit later on, along with replacing the entire head with the one from <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Burlington, NJ (2497 Burlington-Mount Holly Rd)" >}}">Burlington, NJ</a> after that store closed. Sometime after 2021, Chuck's teeth would be broken off, and never fixed.
According to Chuck E. Cheese CEO David McKillips on an Instagram post in April 2024, along with <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Manchester, NH (1525 S Willow St)" >}}">Manchester, NH</a>, and <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Methuen, MA (90 Pleasant Valley Rd)" >}}">Methuen, MA</a>, Everett was said to install the Trampoline Zone, which was fully setup by early May. On July 8, 2024, the store would receive the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/CEC 2018 20 Remodel Program" >}}">2.0 Remodel</a>, removing its show on the same day.
As of August 2024, Everett remains like this with the 2.0 remodel.
