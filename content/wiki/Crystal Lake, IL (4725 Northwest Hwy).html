<h2>Stages</h2>
Crystal Lake opened with a Studio C Alpha. It has stayed mostly the same over the years, but some things have been changed/removed. Chuck received the Cool Chuck outfit sometime in the mid 2000s, and Avenger in 2010. He later got the Avenger hat a year later. The bluescreen was removed in 2014, and the interactive console was removed in early 2015. The Apple TV was removed in 2018, due to the CRT TV not working. The gemini was replaced with a different light after it stopped working in 2019. Curtains were disabled in late 2016. The stage was removed on August 25th, 2024 and replaced with a video wall and dance floor.

<h2>History</h2>
Crystal Lake opened on October 16th, 2000, with the 90s remodel and a Studio C Alpha.

As of today, Crystal Lake is in the middle of remodelling for 2.0, which started on August 25, 2024, and will end in Early September 2024. They removed their stage on August 25th, 2024.
