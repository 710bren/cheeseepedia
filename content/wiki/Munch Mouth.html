<p><b><i>Munch Mouth</b></i> is an arcade machine used in <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Pizza Time Theatre" >}}">Pizza Time Theatre</a>.</p>
<p><h2> Gameplay </h2></p>
<p>The gameplay is unknown, but from the photo we have it seems like you would shoot balls into munch's teeth knocking them down one by one. there was also likely a score to like other games of this type and a timer that would count down to 0.</p>
