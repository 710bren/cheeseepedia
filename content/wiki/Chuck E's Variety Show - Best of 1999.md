<h2> Trivia: </h2>

* This show replaces [Best of CEC TV 1993]({{< ref "wiki/Best of CEC TV 1993.md" >}}) as the emergency backup show for Existing Stages.
* 'Chuck E.'s Dance Party', 'Dancin' and Singin'', 'Hip Mouse', 'Pizza Serenade', 'Chuck E. Town', and 'Let's Dance' are all from [April 1999]({{< ref "wiki/Dance Party 1999.md" >}}), 'Disco Chuck', 'Safety Pin', 'Rockin' Robin', 'Tokens To Ride', are all from Terrific Time Travel (January 1999), and 'Cheese Pizza Is Pure Delight', Boat of Love', 'We Sail The Ocean Blue', and 'We All Love Music' are from Fabulous World Adventure (August 1999).
* This is the first show to feature the Baking with Betty and Clowns Making a Sandwich intermissions on the Existing Stage version. Previously, they were only on the Studio C version of Fabulous World Adventure.
* This is the last showtape with the original backdrop for the puppets with random paints thrown at a wall. The next showtape [Just for Kids Show 2000]({{< ref "wiki/Just for Kids Show 2000.md" >}}) would feature the mostly solid colored backdrops which would be used from April 2000 - September 2011.
* Intermission 12 and Intermission 11 are different for both Existing and Studio C. Existing plays 'Cheese Pizza Is Pure Delight' then 'Boat of Love' and 'We Sail The Ocean Blue' while Studio C goes 'Cheese Pizza Is Pure Delight' then Intermission 11 'Name That Cheese' then plays 'Boat of Love' and 'We Sail The Ocean Blue'. Book Your Party Online is also exclusive to Existing stage tapes. 'Cheese Pizza Is Pure Delight' and 'Hip Mouse' are both sang by Chuck for Studio C while Jasper and Munch sing for Existing stages.
