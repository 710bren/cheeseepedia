<b><i>Magic Night</b></i> is a Rock-afire Explosion showtape released in ShowBiz Pizza Place locations in February 1984.

<h2> Revised Version </h2>
A tape variant labeled <b><i>Magic Night (Revised)</b></i> was released to cut out the dated sections of Segment 8. This cut out the entirety of the intro, and reduced the <i>Michael Jackson Melody</i> to just the song <i>Beat It</i>.<ref>http://www.showbizpizza.com/review/rae/1984_magic.html</ref>

<h2> Part 1-3 Version </h2>
Reels have been found by James Marous that are labeled <b><i>Magic Night Part 1, Magic Night Part 2,</b></i> and <b><i>Magic Night Part 3.</b></i> No other information is known about these tapes. The tapes from his collection were later damaged and are likely unrecoverable.
