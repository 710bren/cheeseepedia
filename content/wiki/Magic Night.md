**_Magic Night**_ is a Rock-afire Explosion showtape released in ShowBiz Pizza Place locations in February 1984.

## Revised Version ##
A tape variant labeled **_Magic Night (Revised)**_ was released to cut out the dated sections of Segment 8. This cut out the entirety of the intro, and reduced the _Michael Jackson Melody_ to just the song _Beat It_.<ref>http://www.showbizpizza.com/review/rae/1984_magic.html</ref>

## Part 1-3 Version ##
Reels have been found by James Marous that are labeled **_Magic Night Part 1, Magic Night Part 2,**_ and **_Magic Night Part 3.**_ No other information is known about these tapes. The tapes from his collection were later damaged and are likely unrecoverable.
