## Trivia: ##
This would be the first showtape to have curtains officially programmed since the [September 2005 Show]({{< ref "wiki/September 2005 Show.md" >}})

At 7:50pm a countdown would start reading 'Show Starts In' with a 10 minute countdown. Once finished playing Together We've Got It 2017 would play. 

According to Logan Carreiro (Chief Animatronics Officer) before the event officially began Together We've Got It 89 played on the cyber stage but no recordings exist.

The 'Next Show Starts Soon' is around a minute long. 

Munch's Make Believe Band Logo Intro is uses about 5 seconds of the Cyberstar Intro audio.
