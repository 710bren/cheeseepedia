## Trivia ##

* This would be the first showtape to have curtains officially programmed since the [September 2005 Show]({{< ref "wiki/September 2005 Show.md" >}}).
* At 7:50pm a countdown would start reading 'Show Starts In' with a 10 minute countdown. Once finished playing, Together We've Got It 2017 would play.
* According to Logan Carreiro (Chief Animatronics Officer), before the event officially began, Segment 1 from the [SPP Concept Unification Premiere]({{< ref "wiki/SPP Concept Unification Premiere.md" >}}) played on the stage. This is most likely false as this would require custom programming to make work.
