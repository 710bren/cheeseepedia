**Winchester Pasqually** was an animatronic featured at the [San Jose, CA (370 S Winchester Blvd) Pizza Time Theater]({{< ref "wiki/San Jose, CA (370 S Winchester Blvd).md" >}}). It would be used from the location's opening until it was replaced by the standard Cyberamic model in 1980.

## History ##

### Winchester ###
Pasqually debuet on May 17, 1977 along with the rest of the Winchester animatronics. When the location first opened, Pasqually was used to call out pizza orders for pickup with the use of a microphone. This was dropped quickly, as orders were placed too quickly for employees to constantly use Pasqually. Pasqually was placed behind double doors, and would emerge from behind them, giving the illusion of popping out of the kitchen. As a result, Pasqually had very few movements:

* Doors
* Mouth
* Eyelids
* Mustache 

In 1980, Pasqually, along with all the other Gen 1 animatronics were removed and replaced with the standard [Cyberamic]({{< ref "wiki/Pasqually (Cyberamic).md" >}}) model.

### After Removal ###
After he was removed from the restaraunt, Pasqually was moved to [Sunnyvale]({{< ref "wiki/Pizza Time Theatre Sunnyvale, CA Corporate Office.md" >}}), persumably along with the other retired Winchester animatronics. He would remain there until Pizza Time Theatre vacated the building following bankruptancy. He would be saved along with Winchester Chuck E. Cheese V2 (Animatronic) (Chuck E. Cheese) and Winchester Jasper T. Jowls (Animatronic) (Jasper T. Jowls) by Jul Kamen.

### Corporate Move and Destruction ###
In the 1990's, [CEC Headquarters]({{< ref "wiki/Showbiz Pizza Time Corporate Office.md" >}}) borrowed the portrait bots from Jul to use in a museum dedicated to CEC's history, the plans for which would never move forward. The bots were used as a display piece until 2004, when CEC Headquarters underwent a remodel. The bots were removed, and ordered to be destroyed, as per CEC's de-identification policy. Jasper and Pasqually were destroyed, the person responsible is speculated to be Gene Cramm, but Chuck E. Cheese was rescued by employees.
