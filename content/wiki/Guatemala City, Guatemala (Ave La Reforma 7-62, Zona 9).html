<b><i>Guatemala City, Guatemala (Ave La Reforma 7-62, Zona 9)</b></i> was a franchised <i>ShowBiz Pizza Place</i> that opened in 1986 and closing in 1996 a <i>Chuck E. Cheese's.</i>

Prior to [Concept Unification]({{< ref "wiki/Concept Unification.html" >}}), the location was not officially acknowledged by [[ShowBiz Pizza Place|Showbiz Pizza Time, Inc.]] during its early years of operation. However, unlike other international ShowBiz stores, Guatemala City may have been the only location outside the United States to be converted into a Chuck E. Cheese's.

<h2> History </h2>
This Showbiz in particular had unique menu items, such as pizzamoffin, pizzpan, and pancakes.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLh73in3pz8</ref>

Prior to its relocation it was remodeled to fit [[1986 SPT Remodel Program|Showbiz Pizza Time's current appearance]].

The location would relocate to [[Guatemala City, Guatemala (Blvd Liberación 6-31, Zona 9)|Blvd Liberación 6-31]] in 1996.

<h2> Stages </h2>
This location's [[Classic Stage|Rock-afire Explosion]] show was originally from the Terre Haute, IN (3820 S US Hwy 41) location, which had just closed about year prior. The show more than likely received Concept Unification prior to 1996.
