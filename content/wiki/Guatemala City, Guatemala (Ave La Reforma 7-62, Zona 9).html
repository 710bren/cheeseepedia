<p><b><i>Guatemala City, Guatemala (Ave La Reforma 7-62, Zona 9)</b></i> was a franchised <i>ShowBiz Pizza Place</i> that opened in 1986 and closing in 1996 a <i>Chuck E. Cheese's.</i></p>
<p>Prior to <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Concept Unification" >}}">Concept Unification</a>, the location was not officially acknowledged by <a href="{{< ref "wiki/ShowBiz Pizza Place" >}}">Showbiz Pizza Time, Inc.</a> during its early years of operation. However, unlike other international ShowBiz stores, Guatemala City may have been the only location outside the United States to be converted into a Chuck E. Cheese's.</p>
<p><h2> History </h2></p>
<p>This Showbiz in particular had unique menu items, such as pizzamoffin, pizzpan, and pancakes.<sup>[1]</sup></p>
<p>Prior to its relocation it was remodeled to fit 1986 SPT Remodel Program|Showbiz Pizza Time's current appearance.</p>
<p>The location would relocate to <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Guatemala City, Guatemala (Blvd Liberación 6-31, Zona 9)" >}}">Blvd Liberación 6-31</a> in 1996.</p>
<p><h2> Stages </h2></p>
<p>This location's <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Classic Stage" >}}">Rock-afire Explosion</a> show was originally from the Terre Haute, IN (3820 S US Hwy 41) location, which had just closed about year prior. The show more than likely received Concept Unification prior to 1996.</p>
