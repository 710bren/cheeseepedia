<h2> Production </h2>
When producing the <i>Abbey Road</i> segment, CEI rented 23 musicians to perform additional instruments, specifically listed are the horns and strings. During <i>Louisiana,</i> CEI moved their drums into a warehouse for recording to provide proper reverberation. <i>Child of the Rock</i> has 15 children from a local elementary school provide the backup vocals.<ref name=':1' />

Three songs on the tape would be original productions by The Noize. <i>Louisiana</i> would be written by Burt 'Sal' Wilson, <i>Child of the Rock</i> would be written by Duke Chauppetta, and <i>Goofy Gas</i> by Jeff 'Claude' Howell.<ref name=':0' />

<h2> Trivia </h2>

* This show was the first to feature Shalisa Sloan as the voice of Mitzi. She was only 11-years-old when she got the part.
* This show was also the first to feature Rick Bailey as a lead vocalist, although not as Beach Bear, but as the Moon in 'Golden Slumbers'. Previously, he had done instrumental work and back-up vocals for the band, but this is his first time singing lead. He would end up replacing Aaron Fechter as the voice of Beach Bear in the following showtape, [RAE Christmas '82]({{< ref "wiki/RAE Christmas '82.html" >}}).
* This is Aaron Fechter's final show recording any new vocals for Beach Bear. Anytime his Beach Bear voice is heard following this tape, it's through reused segments.
* All of the segments from this showtape would go on to be reused in future compilation tapes.
* At the time of it's release, the Abbey Road Medley was the longest individual segment on a Rock-afire showtape, clocking in at 14-minutes. This title has since been taken by longer tracks, however.
