<p>The <b>Video Wall</b> (Also known as the Jumbotron by some.) is an entertainment option found at <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Chuck E Cheese's" >}}">Chuck E. Cheese</a> restaurants. It was first installed in March 2021 at the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Manassas, VA (7730 Stream Walk Ln)" >}}">Manassas, VA (7730 Stream Walk Ln)</a> location.</p>
<p>The Video Walls are installed in present day 2.0 remodels alongside the 2021 Model Dance Floor (some stores receive 2019 Dance Floors instead), with some stores (like <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Howard Beach, NY (133-35 79th St)" >}}">Howard Beach, New York</a>, which did not open with one, as they were planning to open in 2020, before 2021 2.0's started being installed & <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Kennewick, WA (6340 W Rio Grande Ave)" >}}">Kennewick, Washington</a> which was the first 2018 2.0 to receive a Video Wall and kept the old big red piece which would house the TVs; which has 12 TVs throughout the store instead of the usual 9 {Including Video Wall} for 2021 2.0s), later receiving one.</p>
<p>The Video Walls bear a resemblance to the large TV screen featured on the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Circles of Light" >}}">Circles of Light</a> stage, and may or may not be the same model.</p>
<p><h2> Early Concepts / Predecessors (1987-2019) </h2></p>
<p>A concept of a video wall put into Chuck E. Cheese's restaurants first originated back in 1987. In pages 14 and 15 of the 1987 ShowBiz Pizza Time, Inc. Project Status Report (Entertainment '87), it discusses an idea for a video wall. Part of a project titled 'Surprises', the 1987 video wall concept consisted of a bank of 9 to 26 inch video monitors which would play tape footage or a live camera.<sup>[1]</sup> The cost of a prototype would've been $41,000, which would be around $112,001.46 today in 2024. This would've reduced prominence to the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics" >}}">Cyberamics</a> that SPT was installing in Chuck E. Cheese's restaurants at the time. This would be the first time that CEC would not put the spotlight on animatronics as the main entertainment. But the 1987 video wall concept seemed to have not gone past the planning stages, as it was never installed in a Showbiz Pizza Place location nor a Chuck E. Cheese's location.</p>
<p>The video wall concept would be revisited in 1996, and would be visually integrated into the short-lived <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Awesome Adventure Machine" >}}">Awesome Adventure Machine</a> test show at <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Dallas, TX (13125 Montfort Dr)" >}}">Dallas, TX (13125 Montfort Dr)</a>, with the design of two large video monitors and the left and right stages along with an animatronic. This was the first time a video screen-esque setup show was integrated onto a CEC stage. But the AAM test show was scrapped by late 1997, marking the end of a video screen in locations for now.</p>
<p>In 2002, the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Studio C Cappa Prototype" >}}">Small-Town Studio C Buffet</a> test stage would be installed at three locations as part of a new 'Small-Town CEC' idea conceptualized by CEC Entertainment. This stage had a bluescreen and three video monitors above and no animatronic. While not a full video wall, it is similar by having a monitor setup on the wall. This test stage also eliminated the stage where the Chuck E. Cheese animatronic would perform, and is one of the earliest examples of CEC eliminating animatronics in its new stage types. Unlike the 1987 video wall concept or the 1997 Awesome Adventure Machine test show, the Small-Town Studio C Buffet was installed in more than one location. It was installed in Waco, Texas in June 2002, Lake Jackson, Texas in October 2002, and finally in Dover, Delaware in December 2002. These 3 shows ended up being replaced between 2003 and 2006 at these 3 stores respectively. And the Studio C Buffet concept eventually turn into the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Studio C Cappa" >}}">Studio C Cappa</a> in 2003.</p>
<p>Starting in August 2012, the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Circles of Light" >}}">Circles of Light</a> stage began installation as the replacement for the then almost 12-year old <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Studio C Beta" >}}">Studio C Beta</a> stage, and as the new show for future Chuck E. Cheese's locations nationwide. It made its debut at <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Dallas, TX (13364 Montfort Dr)" >}}">Dallas, TX (13364 Montfort Dr)</a> as a replacement for its short-lived Star Stage test show. This stage was filled with colorful lights on left and right and a large screen in the center. In September of that year, the 32m CEC animatronic was removed from Montfort's COL possibly to make room for live show performances by the CEC walkaround.</p>
<p>Circles of Light shows continued to be installed in United States CEC locations that were either new and old up to December 2018, and continued to be installed in new international CEC locations up to February 2023. From September 2012 to August 2013, every new Circles of Light stage installed in a location came with an animatronic. From September 2013 to December 2018, most locations onward would receive COL stages without an animatronic. The exception to this was for locations that had a COL with a recycled 32m or 16m CEC animatronic, franchised locations that got a new bot either reused or new, or in the case of <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Los Angeles, CA (2706 Wilshire Blvd)" >}}">Los Angeles, CA (2706 Wilshire Blvd)</a> or <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Kapolei, HI (700 Haumea St)" >}}">Kapolei, HI (700 Haumea St)</a>, take 3 years of store construction. Franchised Chuck E. Cheese's locations would receive Circles of Light stages with a 16m or 32m bot from May 2013 up to October 2018.</p>
<p>The Circles of Light show replaced 4 animatronic shows in Chuck E. Cheese's locations between March 2014 and September 2017. In March 2014, <a href="{{< ref "wiki/San Antonio, TX (6874 Ingram Rd)" >}}">San Antonio, TX (6874 Ingram Rd)</a> replaced their <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Concept Unification Stage" >}}">3-Stage</a> for a bot-less Circles of Light, and was later removed for their 2.0 remodel in 2017. Sometime between late 2014 and early 2015, Rohnert Park, California replaced their <a href="{{< ref "wiki/1-Stage" >}}">1-Stage</a> with a bot-less Circles of Light, with their stage being sent to <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Citrus Heights, CA (6251 Sunrise Blvd)" >}}">Citrus Heights, CA (6251 Sunrise Blvd)</a>, where it remained until January 2024 when it was removed during Citrus Heights' 2.0 refresh remodel. This would mark the beginning of video screen shows replacing the older stage shows.</p>
<p>In February 2015, <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Matteson, IL (106 Town Center Rd)" >}}">Matteson, IL (106 Town Center Rd)</a> had to remove its 3-Stage due to a fire damage the store went through, and was replaced with a Circles of Light stage along with a interior-only Rockstar Chuck remodel. It remained until Matteson's closure in June 2020, but the show was left behind after the store was vacated. In September 2017, <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Wilmington, DE (3601 Silverside Rd)" >}}">Wilmington, DE (3601 Silverside Rd)</a> replaced their 3-Stage with a recycled bot-less Circles of Light from San Antonio, TX (6874 Ingram Rd), where it remained until Wilmington closed down on October 12, 2020.</p>
<p>In August 2019, <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Philadelphia, PA (9175 Roosevelt Blvd)" >}}">Philadelphia, PA (9175 Roosevelt Blvd)</a> had to remove its <a href="{{< ref "wiki/2-Stage" >}}">2-Stage</a> due to flood damage the store had gone through, and was replaced with a large TV screen on the wall with a green bordered monitor, in similar fashion to the Circles of Light stage, although without the light circles. This store was the very first 2.0 store to receive a video screen, and was very much a prototype to the Video Wall.</p>
<p>In October 2019, <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Mobile, AL (710 Downtowner Loop)" >}}">Mobile, AL (710 Downtowner Loop)</a> replaced its <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Concept Unification Stage" >}}">3-Stage</a> during their fall 2019 2.0 remodel with 2 small TV's on the 3-Stage's former spot, along with 2 character bio posters of Chuck E. Cheese and Helen Henny near them. This setup was more of a TV wall than an actual Video Wall. This would be seen as mediocre by many due to only having the art of 2 characters in the area and then having two screens between. However, the lackluster setup was fixed when Mobile received the Video Wall in June 2023.</p>
<p><h2> Now (2021-present) </h2></p>
<p>Finally, in March 2021, the finalized 2.0 video wall made its debut at the remodeled <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Manassas, VA (7730 Stream Walk Ln)" >}}">Manassas, VA</a> location, after 34 years of early ideas and predecessors.</p>
<p>When 2.0 Remodels started being installed, the only TV's in the store were the 6 small TV's mounted on the ceiling directly above the Dance Floor. This would change in 2021 when 2.0 Remodels were updated to include a large screen embedded into the wall where the character biographies are seen.</p>
