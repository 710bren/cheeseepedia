The <b><i>Winchester Warblettes Animatronic</b></i> was an animatronic produced in 1977 by [Fantasy Forest]({{< ref "wiki/Fantasy Forest.md" >}}) for the [Pizza Time Theatre]({{< ref "wiki/Pizza Time Theatre.md" >}}) location on [San Jose, CA (370 S Winchester Blvd)]({{< ref "wiki/San Jose, CA (370 S Winchester Blvd).md" >}}). The bot used the [Winchester Hardware Setup]({{< ref "wiki/Winchester Hardware Setup.md" >}}) for programming & the [Winchester Control System]({{< ref "wiki/Winchester Control System.md" >}}) for controlling the bots movements.

The bot was replaced in 1981 when Winchester got [Cyberamics]({{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics.md" >}}).
