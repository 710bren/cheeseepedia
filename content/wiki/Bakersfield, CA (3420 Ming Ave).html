<p><h2> History </h2></p>
<p>Bakersfield opened in December 1981 (day unknown) with a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage" >}}">Balcony Stage</a>. This predated the Bakersfield SPP by 11 months. Nothing is known about this location at all, however. The store would close in 1984 (month and day unknown) due to underperformance. As of today, the store is now part of a TJMaxx.</p>
