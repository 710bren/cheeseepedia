**_4631 Commercial Dr**_ was a _Chuck E. Cheese's_ that opened on October 30, 2006 with a [[Studio C Cappa]], which closed in June 2020 during a wave of closures due to the company's bankruptcy.

This location is not to be confused with the _Pizza Time Theatre_ location, [[New Hartford / Utica, NY (8555 Seneca Turnpike)]], which was open from 1982-1985. 

##  Stages ## 
The location opened with the 'V3' variant of the [[Studio C Cappa]]. The stage remained intact until the location's closure.

The animatronic had its eyebrows and hat removed at some point during its history.
