<b><i>Creative Engineering Inc.</b></i> is an animatronics oriented entertainment and manufacturing company founded by <b><i>Aaron Fechter</b></i> in 1975 and stopped its major business ventures and employment in the early 2000's. It now continues to run solely by its creator as a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Creative Engineering Premium Video Service" >}}">paid video platform</a>, animatronics / parts reseller, and (formerly) a fandom tourist destination, with most of these current operations inactive as they begin plans to open a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Creative Engineering Workshop" >}}">parts warehouse</a> and <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Creative Engineering Museum" >}}">museum</a>.

The company is most well known for its creation of the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Rock-afire Explosion" >}}">Rock-afire Explosion</a> for <a href="{{< ref "wiki/ShowBiz Pizza Place" >}}">ShowBiz Pizza Place</a>, which has become its frontrunning IP to present day.
