## History ##
In 1985, Showbiz Pizza acquired Pizza Time Theatre; and to unify all locations as a company, a remodel imitative was proposed in 1986.

## Exterior ##
PTT and SPP exteriors were all made uniform in appearance. All logos would be changed to either say 'Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza' or 'Showbiz Pizza'.

## Interior ##
Interiors were all painted a plain white with red, blue, green, and yellow checkers being painted on the highest point of the walls. The counters were all also unified to have the ordering area in front of you as soon as you walk in.
