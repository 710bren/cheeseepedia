<p><h2> History </h2></p>
<p>Chino was Supposed to open in mid 1987 as a Showbiz Pizza Place with SPP Phase 1 and a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Classic Stage" >}}">Classic Stage</a> these plans were scrapped due to <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Concept Unification" >}}">a problem with Aaron Fechter and SPT Inc.</a> so thus it was pushed to Opening on Late December the next year. Chino finally opened on December 30, 1988, under the name <i>Showbiz Pizza</i>, the 1986 SPT Remodel Program|1988 remodel, and the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House" >}}">Rocker Stage</a>.</p>
<p>During April 1994, they received <a href="{{< ref "wiki/SPT 1992 Remodel Program" >}}">Operation: Thumb Chuck</a> and <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Phase 1 (1994)" >}}">Phase 1</a>, which involved removing all 1988 remodel elements, removing neon signage, changing the exterior to <i>Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza</i> like the one in La Mesa, CA, and replaced their <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House" >}}">Rocker Stage</a> with a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/2-Stage" >}}">2-Stage</a>. Interestingly, they had the newer decor before receiving the 2-Stage. They later received <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Phase 2 (1997)" >}}">Phase 2</a> and <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Phase 3 (2000)" >}}">Phase 3</a> in their respective years. In Summer 1995, they removed the Pizza sign and the PTT style Coach Chuck Logo for the Star Chuck Logo. Around the early 2000’s they replaced all the Bots' (except Munch's) masks from the 90’s, around the same time they expanded to a local store that had closed down (where the video wall is now), which meant more games.</p>
<p>In 2006, they received the 2005 update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative|Operation: Avenger Chuck Remodel, removing (almost) all 90s decor for new decor, removing the showroom walls. Adding purple walls, downsizing the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Skytubes" >}}">Skytubes</a> and changing the exterior again for the Avenger Chuck Logo. The <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Skytubes" >}}">Skytubes</a> were removed in August 2019.</p>
<p>Chino remained like this until November 18th 2022, when they would begin the 2017 2.0 Remodel Program|2.0 remodel, removing the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/2-Stage" >}}">2-Stage</a> for a 2021 Model <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Chuck E Live Stage (Dance Floor)" >}}">Dance Floor</a> and <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Video Wall" >}}">Video Wall</a>. During early August 2024, Chino Received the new <a href="{{< ref "wiki/CEC 2018 20 Remodel Program" >}}">Trampoline Zone</a> alongside <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Huntington Beach, CA (15511 Edwards St)" >}}">Huntington Beach, CA</a>, as of Fall 2024, Chino remains like this.</p>
<p><h2> Trivia </h2></p>
<p>- If you look closely at the Phase 4 Exterior, you can see a label Scar of the <b>ShowBiz Pizza</b> Letters</p>
<p>- Interestingly, the location never had Balcony Seating, although many say so.</p>
<p>- Many people thought that the place where the video wall is now was the old Showroom, A video of Chino in 1994 debunked this.</p>
<p>- Munch Kept his PTT Mask until the 2.0 Remodel.</p>
<p>- This location had a 'medium' Sized 2-Stage, which was kind-of rare to see back before its removal. The Medium sized 2-Stage is now Extinct.</p>
<p>- This Location had an original Helicopter light up until its removal.</p>
<p>- The location never received new parts after 2017 since the bots were in awesome condition before 2020.</p>
<p>- Chino had a 'Make Magic' sign along with some Phase 3 art. It is unknown if the location still has the Make Magic sign after the 2.0 Remodel.</p>
