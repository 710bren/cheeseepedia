<p><b>2655 Oak Valley Dr, Store #334</b> was a Chuck E. Cheese's that opened on November 2, 2000 with a Studio C Alpha, which closed on December 2, 2020.</p>
<p>This location received the 16M Chuck E. animatronic from the Muskegon, Michigan store in June 2020, essentially turning it into a Studio C Alpha, 16M.</p>
<p>Also, this location should not be confused with Ann Arbor, MI (2196 W Stadium Blvd) which was a Pizza Time Theatre location that opened on December 30, 1981 with the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage" >}}">Balcony Stage</a> and closed in 1985 with the Family Album.</p>
<p><h2>History </h2></p>
<p>TODO</p>
<p><h2>Stages</h2></p>
<p>Originally when the store opened, they had a Studio C Alpha with a 32M Chuck E. animatronic. they would have the stage until they closed, but in June 2020, they replaced their 32M figure with a 16M figure which came from the Muskegon, Michigan (Muskegon had one of the original 7 'V1' Studio C Cappas), which closed in June 2020. As of October 2022, they have been the only Studio C Alpha to feature a 16M character (Alphas normally have the 32M character). they would have the 'Studio C Alpha, 16M' for only 5-6 months, when they would close on December 2nd, 2020, possibly of the COVID-19 Pandemic, and the financial situation of CEC Entertainment, Chuck E. Cheese's parent company.</p>
