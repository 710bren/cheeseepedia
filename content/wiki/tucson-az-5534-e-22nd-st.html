<h2>History</h2>
The store would open on July 15th, 1980 in the <i>County Fair Shopping Center</i> with a Portrait Stage.
This was also the first Chuck E. Cheese of any kind to open in the state of Arizona.
Not much is known about the location other than the one photo of the store's exterior and a photo of the Portrait Stage taken from a memorial website.
The store was then closed in 1987 for unknown reasons (though it may have been underperforming, a reason for many store closures around the same time) after operating for around 7 years. The show's fate is unknown.
The store would become a few businesses or two until the shopping center was redeveloped in 2007. The original Pizza Time Theatre was expanded and redeveloped and is currently part of a Walmart Neighborhood Market.
