<b><i>4420 14th St</b></i> was a <i>Pizza Time Theatre</i> that opened in October 1981 and closed on June 16th, 1984.

This location is not to be confused with the <i>Showbiz Pizza Place</i> on [[Bradenton, FL (415 Cortez Rd)|415 Cortez Rd]] which opened on March 25th, 1982 and closed in 1985/1986 with a [[Classic Stage|Rock-afire Explosion]] or the current <i>Chuck E. Cheese</i> location on [[Bradenton, FL (905 44th Ave)|905 44th Ave]] which opened on March 3rd, 1999 with a [[Studio C (1997)|Studio C Alpha]] which got removed in April 2023 for a [[Chuck E. Live Stage (Dance Floor)|2021 Model Dance Floor]] & [Video Wall]({{< ref "wiki/Video Wall.html" >}}), that store still operates to this day.

<h2> History </h2>
Bradenton opened with Harmony Howlette and presumably The King. Bradenton would later get Madame Oink, and of course Helen who stayed until Bradenton relocated. This was the sixth Pizza Time Theatre to open in the state of Florida.

After Bradenton closed on June 16th, 1984, the store had an auction like most PTTs. The standalone building was reoccupied by Olive Garden, which is still open to this day.

<h2> Stages </h2>
Bradenton opened and closed with a Balcony Stage.
