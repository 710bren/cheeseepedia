<p><h2> History </h2></p>
<p>Bradenton opened with Harmony Howlette and presumably The King. Bradenton would later get Madame Oink, and of course Helen who stayed until Bradenton relocated. This was the sixth Pizza Time Theatre to open in the state of Florida.</p>
<p>After Bradenton closed on June 16th, 1984, the store had an auction like most PTTs. The standalone building was reoccupied by Olive Garden, which is still open to this day.</p>
<p><h2> Stages </h2></p>
<p>Bradenton opened and closed with a Balcony Stage.</p>
