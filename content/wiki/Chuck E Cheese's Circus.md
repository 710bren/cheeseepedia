**_Chuck E. Cheese's Circus**_ is a coin-operated _Amutec_ _[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiddie_ride Kiddie Ride]_ featuring _Chuck E. Cheese_ branding.

The van is the standard _Amutec_ 'Circus Van' vehicle in its yellow variant, with the large 'Circus' sticker replaced with a CEC variant. No other parts of the ride were changed.

##Animal Display##
The right side of the van featured a small display of caged plush animals behind bars and a plastic screen. It is unclear whether the CEC version ever replaced these standard plushies with CEC branded plushies, or if any specific stores did this on their own.
