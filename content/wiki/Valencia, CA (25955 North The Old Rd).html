<b><i>25955 North The Old Rd</b></i> is a Chuck E. Cheese location in Valencia, California.

The Chuck E. Cheese in Valencia, CA (also known as Stevenson Ranch) opened on March 4, 1998, with a [1-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/1-Stage.html" >}}). It was one of the last 1-stages installed. It should not be confused with the [Valencia, CA (23154 Valencia Blvd)]({{< ref "wiki/Valencia, CA (23154 Valencia Blvd).html" >}}), which was a Pizza Time Theatre/Chuck E Cheese that opened April 1983 and closed February 1996.

<h2> History </h2>
Stevenson Ranch opened on March 4, 1998 with a 1-Stage.

The 1-Stage would remain until January 2023, when the store would receive the [CEC 2018 2.0 Remodel Program]({{< ref "wiki/CEC 2018 20 Remodel Program.html" >}}), removing the 1-Stage in favor of a dance floor and video wall. The animatronics would be sent to the [[Pasadena, CA (3737 E Foothill Blvd)|Pasadena, CA]] location, which would have its stage and animatronics removed in their remodel in February 2024.
