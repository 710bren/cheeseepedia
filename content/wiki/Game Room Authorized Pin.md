The <b><i>Game Room Authorized Pin</b></i> was released in 2017 with a new wave of pins.  This pin was given to CEC employees for passing the 'Game Room Training Course' test, to be worn on their lanyard.
<h2>Design</h2>
The design is a metal pin featuring Helen Henny's head with stars on a pink ticket with text saying, 'GAME ROOM AUTHORIZED'. This design also temporarily replaced the Gameroom Certified Pin (Rockstar) pin. The Gameroom Certified Pin (Rockstar) had a short re-release at the start of 2023 for select stores under a slight change of design. 
<h2>Acquirement</h2>
Employees could receive this pin if they passed the Game Room Training Course test on the CEC Connect tablet.
