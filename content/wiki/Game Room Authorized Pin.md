The **_Game Room Authorized Pin**_ was released in 2017 with a new wave of pins.  This pin was given to CEC employees for passing the 'Game Room Training Course' test, to be worn on their lanyard.
##Design##
The design is a metal pin featuring Helen Henny's head with stars on a pink ticket with text saying, 'GAME ROOM AUTHORIZED'. This design also temporarily replaced the [Gameroom Certified Pin (Rockstar)]({{< ref "wiki/Gameroom Certified Pin (Rockstar).md" >}}){< ref "wiki/Gameroom Certified Pin (Rockstar).md" >}}) pin. The [Gameroom Certified Pin (Rockstar)]({{< ref "wiki/Gameroom Certified Pin (Rockstar).md" >}}) had a short re-release at the start of 2023 for select stores under a slight change of design. 
##Acquirement##
Employees could receive this pin if they passed the Game Room Training Course test on the CEC Connect tablet.
