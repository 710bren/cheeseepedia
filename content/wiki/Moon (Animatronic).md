The <b>Moon Animatronic</b> is an animatronic figure created by Creative Engineering Inc. for Showbiz Pizza Place locations from 1980-1983. It is a very simple figure, as its only movements are its raising from behind the backdrop and opening its mouth. Moon would later be used during [Concept Unification]({{< ref "wiki/Concept Unification Stage.md" >}}), where it would go unchanged.

<h2> Movements </h2>
Moon features 2 movements, being its head raise, and mouth.
