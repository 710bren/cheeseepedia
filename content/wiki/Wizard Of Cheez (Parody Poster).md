**Wizard Of Cheez** was a poster for Showbiz Pizza and Chuck E Cheese in 1988.

## History ##
This poster was one of the many Chuck E Cheese's parody posters released in 1988. It is believed that after 1991, production of this poster and the other Chuck E Cheese's movie parody posters would cease.

Over the years, this poster would become very rare to find in stores nationwide as remodels would occur and the removal of this poster and rest of the movie parody posters. It's believed that last location that have this poster was Silver Spring MD which closed in August of 2016.

## Design ##
The poster is a parody of the 1939 film, Wizard Of OZ, with Pasqually, Harmony Howlett, Artie Antlers, Madame Oink, and The King all making an appearance on the poster. On the top left of the poster there's three words that read, 'Imaginative!', 'Inspiring!', and 'Italian!'.  On top of the movie logo, there's names called 'Roman Colluseum', 'Gonda Leer', and 'Lee Ningtower'. Most likely referenced to the parody names of the PTT characters. In the middle of the movie logo there's a quote that reads 'It's Macon-Golden-Pizza's Technicolor Triumph'.
