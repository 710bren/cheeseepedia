<p><h2> History:</h2></p>
<p>Grand Chute, also known as Appleton, opened on March 19th, 1998, with the 1993 Remodel, Due to this being one of the first <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Studio C Alpha" >}}">Studio C Alpha</a><nowiki/>s to be installed the store featured record posters instead of the normal Must C TVs. The rest of the posters were the same ones that would be seen in any store that gained the 1993 remodel and with that they also had showroom walls.</p>
<p>By 2014, they'd receive purple walls and would remove the shelves in the showroom. Otherwise, the original exterior, most of the original décor, and even the showroom walls were left intact. The apple TV was also removed by then but replaced with a regular smaller screen.</p>
<p>They would have this until sometime on September 23, 2019, when they would undergo the 2.0 remodel, this meant removing the animatronic stage and replacing it with a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Chuck E Live Stage (Dance Floor)" >}}">Dance Floor</a>, this would also mark the removal for all the 90s décor and removal of the show room walls. The store would have its Grand Re-Opening on December 3, 2019. This remodel would only last 6 months as in June 2020 the store would permanently close because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and CEC Entertainment filing for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy during that time. After closure, Grand Chute sent several games and other things to the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Green Bay, WI (1273 Lombardi Access)" >}}">Green Bay</a> location.
