**_7448 Amador Valley Blvd, Store #322**_ is a Chuck E. Cheese's that opened on August 1st, 1994 with a 1-Stage, which is still open to this day.

This is not to be confused with the [\2](\1) located in the same plaza that opened April 21st, 1982 and closed in December 1985 with the [\2](\1).

##  History ## 
Dublin opened on August 1st, 1994 in a freestanding building in an unnamed plaza on Amador Valley Blvd. The store opened with [\2](\1) of the [\2](\1) which involved the addition of the Toddler Zone, and some other things. Dublin would remain this way until around 2011 which is when they received the 2010 Update to the [[2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative]] which involved the removal of Showroom Walls, 1990's decor, Dim Lighting, adding an extra door to the Showroom, and the reconfiguration of the front counter (It is unknown if Dublin ever had Balcony Seating). As of April 2023, Dublin still has the 2010 Update and the 1-Stage.

##  Stages ## 
Originally when the store opened, they had a 1-Stage, which also had a turntable, which they still have but not operational. When first installed, Chuck E had the Tuxedo & Derby outfit like all other 1-Stages and a functional turntable that turned when a Live or a Birthday Show played. Between 2009-2012, Pasqually's mask would be replaced. In 2018, Chuck's mask would be replaced with [\2](\1)'s which got 2.0 in 2018. In March 2023, Jasper's mask would replaced with one from [\2](\1) which possibly got a new Jasper mask or it could of been a spare one they had backstage. As of April 2023, Dublin still has the 1-Stage.
