<big>From Chuck-E-Pedia</big>


**_10901 N Rodney Parham Road**_ was a _Chuck E. Cheese's_ located in Little Rock, Arkansas.

This store began as a Showbiz, and even after its conversion into a Chuck E. Cheese, it kept many of its Showbiz elements. It is one of few post-Showbiz stores to have kept the wood paneled walls bordering the 3-stage, all the way up to its closure; giving it a distinct look.
