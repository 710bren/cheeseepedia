**_106 Town Center Road**_ was a _Showbiz Pizza Place_ which opened on May 23, 1983 with a Rock-Afire Explosion, and closed on June 18, 2020 with the Circles of Light stage.

##History##
Matteson opened its doors on May 25th, 1983 with the Rock-Afire Explosion show like every other Showbiz Pizza. It was originally a corporate-owned location. It also was originally opened next to a Toys R us which opened in June 1978. In either 1989 or 1990, Matteson received the 1988 remodel removing the older SPP decor, adding newer decor, received a new exterior change, and updated the Billy Bob stage. In 1991 or 1992, Matteson received a major remodel, adding checkers around the wall, added Blue and White Awnings, and added more decor and removed some older decor, and received Concept Unification removing the Rock-Afire Explosion for the 3-Stage. Matteson received a minor remodel in the Mid-90's removing older CU decor for the Record Posters. Around the late 90's, Matteson would receive the Phase 2 remodel which removed all older 90's decor, added newer decor, and added SkyTubes. The Kmart was then rebuilt during these changes to the CEC. In 2009-2010, Matteson received the 2005 remodel removing older decor, removing the Showroom Walls, Balcony Seating, expanding the store, and relocating the stage. Unfortunately, Matteson caught on fire in 2014 which involved the removal of the 3-Stage for the Circles of Light stage. Toys R Us closed in June 2018 with the company's bankruptcy. Matteson closed on June 18th, 2020 as one of the 34 stores listed for the closure. After closure, the location became abandoned.

Currently, as of March 2023, the building is still abandoned.
