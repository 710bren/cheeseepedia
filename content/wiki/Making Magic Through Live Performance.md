We're excited to bring you this training video on live performance in our restaurants. You will learn key points to performing, not only in Live Shows, Road Shows, and Birthday Parties, but in everything you do as a Cast Member! It's like we're all actors on a stage and the play is called Chuck E. Cheese's. This video will not only help you give a great performance for our guests, but it will show you how to have fun while doing it. Let's break a leg!

## Summary ##
The tape goes over performing as a Cast Member for all duties in the restaurant. It additionally focuses on Live Shows, Road Shows, and Birthday Parties.

The video follows Joey, Kelley, and Robert Gotcher as they pretend to be peering through a restaurant with security cameras and following the Cast Member's jobs as they perform. Midway through Aaron comes out in a Chuck E. Avenger suit to describe how to properly perform in the walkarounds. Heather then shows how to do Road Shows.
