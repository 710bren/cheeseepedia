**_CEC-Stage Rosetta**_ was a special software created by _Dave Philipson_ in 2001 used to translate programming from the [3-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/3-Stage.md" >}}){< ref "wiki/3-Stage.md" >}}) to the [Cyberamics]({{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics.md" >}}){< ref "wiki/Cyberamics.md" >}}) stage.

This was done to reduce unneeded programming of characters across both stages, and began use in the [Fabulous World Adventure]({{< ref "wiki/Fabulous World Adventure.md" >}}) showtape of August 1999. The name _CEC-Stage Rosetta_ was used as the software could be described as 'Translating' the programming information from the [3-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/3-Stage.md" >}}) [Bit Chart]({{< ref "wiki/Bit Chart.md" >}}) to the [Cyberamics]({{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics.md" >}}) equivalent bits.

## Conversion Process ##
The conversion process can be reverse engineered by comparing multiple showtapes' signals from both stages. Given this, showtapes where signal data is lost or private for CEC-Stage can be recreated from the official conversion chart, assuming no bugs or additional programming wasn't added in the official release.

Bits will be named and numbered by their conversion to the **_Road, 1 + 2**_ bit chart format. Other Cyberamic stages before the creation of the _CEC-Stage Rosetta_ software would be using the bits for different purposes.
