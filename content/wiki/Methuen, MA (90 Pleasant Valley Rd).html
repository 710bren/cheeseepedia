<p><b><i>90 Pleasant Valley Rd, Store #752</b></i> is a <i>Chuck E. Cheese's</i> location that opened on August 28th, 2000. It's located in a shopping plaza called 'The Loop'.</p>
<p><h2> History </h2></p>
<p>Prior to CEC opening, the space was the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Loop_(shopping_center) Methuen Mall], and was redeveloped in 2000 as The Loop, an open air strip mall.</p>
<p>Methuen officially opened August 28th, 2000, with a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Studio C Alpha" >}}">Studio C Alpha</a>. This was the 2nd Studio C in New England after <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Warwick, RI (650 Bald Hill Rd)" >}}">Warwick</a> and the first in Massachusetts.</p>
<p>In 2005, Methuen disabled their curtains, before re-enabling them in 2007. They swapped out Late Night for the Cool Chuck outfit between 2006-2009. They got the Avenger outfit by 2011, while keeping the original cap. By the end of September 2013, the Late Night/Cool Chuck cap was removed.</p>
<p>In November 2014, Methuen began their remodel to the 2013 Update of the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/CEC 2005 Remodel Program" >}}">CEC 2005 Remodel</a>, along with the store in <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Everett, MA (29 Mystic View Rd)" >}}">Everett, Massachusetts</a>. The Blue Screen camera was also removed by this time. In 2016, the curtains were disabled yet again. In early 2017, the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Interactive Console" >}}">Interactive Console</a> was removed, marking the extinction of the console in New England.</p>
<p>On April 20, 2024, Methuen received the Trampoline Zone. The trampolines were fully setup by late May.</p>
<p>On July 8, 2024, the store would start its <a href="{{< ref "wiki/CEC 2018 20 Remodel Program" >}}">2.0 Remodel</a>, removing the stage on the same day. The grand reopening would be held on August 28th, 2004. <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Helen Henny" >}}">Helen Henny</a>, <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Mr Munch" >}}">Mr. Munch</a>, and <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Jasper T Jowls" >}}">Jasper T.
