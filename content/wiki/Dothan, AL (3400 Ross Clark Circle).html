<b><i>3400 Ross Clark Circle</b></i> was a <i>Showbiz Pizza Place</i>/<i>Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza</i> in Dothan, Alabama that opened in December 1983 (Unknown Day) and closed on April 23, 1998.

This is not to be confused with the current location on [[Dothan, AL (1001 Commons Dr)|1001 Commons Dr]] that opened on  August 19th, 2004 with a Small-Town Studio C and is still open to this day.

<h2> History </h2>
Dothan opened sometime in December 1983 as the eighth or ninth Showbiz Pizza Place in Alabama as a franchised-owned store. Dothan originally featured the Rock-afire Explosion, as all other Showbiz locations did. they would have it for a few years, until around 1991/1992, when they would receive Concept Unification and the 1986 SPT Remodel Program. Not long after the store received Concept Unification, the store was featured in the CEC cast member highlight reel alongside 8 other locations (Dothan was the only Alabama location to be featured in the highlights). It is unknown of the store received the [[Phase 1 (1994)|Phase 1]] or [[Phase 2 (1997)|Phase 2]] game packages. (but since Pizza Kastle had a CEC branded 1996 air hockey machine, it can be assumed they did.) The store would remain this way until they closed on April 23, 1998. Sometime after CEC closed, the store was converted to a knock-off Willy Wonka themed FEC called 'Chunk-A-Wonkas Pizza Factory', most likely due to copyright issues the store was converted into Kidz Kastle, which would later be converted into Pizza Kastle. By 2010, Pizza Kastle closed and would remain vacant for years until sometime in 2022 when the building was converted into a bank. There was once a plan to build a hotel on the site and change the address to 3394 Ross Clark Circle, but never happened.

<h2> Stages </h2>
Originally, Dothan featured a Rock-afire Explosion, as all other Showbiz locations did. In 1991, they would undergo Concept Unification, turning the Rock-afire Explosion into the 3-Stage. They would have the 3-Stage until the store's closure on April 23, 1998.
