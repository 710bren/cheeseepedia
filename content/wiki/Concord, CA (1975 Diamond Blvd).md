<b><i>Concord, CA (1975 Diamond Blvd, Building D-100)</b></i> was the third <i>Pizza Time Theatre</i> location that opened sometime within the week of May 28th - April 3rd of 1979 with a Cyberamics Portrait Stage (Portrait Stage) and two floors, which closed in January of 1994 with a [Road Stage]({{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Road Stage.md" >}}).

It should not be confused with Concord, CA (1611 Willow Pass Rd), which opened on June 18th, 2009, with a Studio C 2000 (Studio C 2000, 16m) and is still operating to this day.

<h2> History </h2>
The store would open in May of 1979 at the <i>Willows Shopping Center</i> with its manager being Rob Schmidt.<ref>https:<i>archive.org/details/the-pizza-times-newsletters/1979%20The%20Pizza%20Times%201-1/</ref> Its restaurant would be on the first floor, and the arcade on the second floor.<ref>https:</i>forums.atariage.com/topic/240567-what-was-chuck-e-cheese-like-back-in-the-1980s/</ref>

In November/December of 1979, the [Pizza Time Theatre 1979 Spot]({{< ref "wiki/Pizza Time Theatre 1979 Spot (Commercial).md" >}}) commercial would be filmed at the location.

In May of 1980 the assistant manager of the store, Sheri Walther, would win the <i>Pizza Times</i> 'Name this Newsletter' contest alongside two others who suggested the same name, with all three splitting the prize.

The store would appear on KTVU on March 26, 1981.<ref>https://archive.org/details/the-pizza-times-newsletters/1981%20The%20Pizza%20Times%201-1/page/n3/mode/2up?q=concord</ref>

The store would close in January of 1994 for unknown reasons, being replaced by a UFC Gym which is still around to present day.
