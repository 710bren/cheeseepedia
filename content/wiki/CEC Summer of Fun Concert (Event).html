<h2> Summary: </h2>
With the help of Jessi & Chuck E.'s Crew (Minus Pasqually) they're able to put on a show to entertain the guests using a mix of live shows and normal shows.

<h2> Trivia: </h2>

* Play All You Can Play replaces Chucks vocals with helens during his 'Solo' and then replaces Munch's vocals with Helens during his 'Solo'
* Dog Days of Summer removes the rest of backing vocals and has Helen be the only backup singer and also sings some of Jaspers lines.
* Chuck E. Cheese's Birthday Song re-recorded all the backing vocals meaning you can now hear Helen, Jasper and DJ Munch clearly now
* Happy Birthday (Spanish) was rerecorded with the US voice actors. 
* Song of Summer (Concert Remix) has Jessi sing Bella's lines and also ends the song after they all sing 'Sing a song of summer with me' to fade into them saying their goodbyes.
