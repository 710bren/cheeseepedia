The **'Chuck Trek' (Must C TV Award)** was a poster created for Chuck E. Cheese in 1998.

## Design ##
This poster features a Star Trek parody, where the Star Trek Ship is replaced with a Chuck E. Cheese themed space ship with front of the ship being the face of Chuck E. Cheese with the bottom of the ship having a Pizza shooting out a laser bean while the spaceship is travelling at high speed throughout the galaxy. 

## Trivia ##
This wasn't CEC Entertainment's first attempt at making a parody Star Trek Poster. In 1993, they designed a Star Trek crew poster which has all 5 members of the band (Chuck E., Helen, Jasper, Munch, and Pasqually) inside of a space ship while dressed up as the main characters from Star Trek. However, this poster was never released to stores and only seen at the old corporate offices.

## Size/Dimensions ##
Like the other 'Must C TV' posters, this was made larger than actual TV posters, so it'd be cheaper and easier to retrofit the Phase 2 'record posters' with them.

## Reception ##
The poster originally received generally positive reception upon release, however, as time passed, it began to get a more negative reception, with many critics of the Original Phase Trilogy using this as a literal poster child for showing how dated pre-2005 Chuck E. Cheese's stores are. Nowadays, it does have a cult following, either due to how absurd the poster is, or due to the 90s nostalgia boom.
