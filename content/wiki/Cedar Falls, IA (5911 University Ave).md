<b><i>5911 University Ave Ste. 100</b></i> is a <i>Chuck E. Cheese's</i> that opened on August 1, 2001, with a [Studio C Beta]({{< ref "wiki/Studio C Beta.md" >}}) and is still open today with the 2.0 remodel.

This was the relocation of the Cedar Falls, IA (2915 McClain Dr) store, which opened on December 28, 1981, with a [Rock-afire Explosion]({{< ref "wiki/Classic Stage.md" >}}) and closed in January 2001 (day unknown) with a [3-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/Concept Unification Stage.md" >}}).

<h2> Stages </h2>
Cedar Falls at first had a [Studio C Beta]({{< ref "wiki/Studio C Beta.md" >}}) with a 32m bot. The stage would get minor modifications until September 2022, when it was removed as part of the 2.0 remodel.

<h2> History </h2>
Cedar Falls opened on August 1, 2001, with a Phase 3 remodel and [Studio C Beta]({{< ref "wiki/Studio C Beta.md" >}}). Unfortunately, there isn't much info on Cedar Falls from this time. In 2006-2008, Cedar Falls received the 2005 update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative, which involved the removal of 90s decor, dim lighting, changed the exterior, and added purple walls. The Skytubes were removed some time afterwards. In late-August 2022, the location began 2.0, removing the Beta for a 2021 Model Chuck E. Live Stage (Dance Floor) (Dance Floor) and [Video Wall]({{< ref "wiki/Video Wall.md" >}}). As of August 2023, Cedar Falls remains like this.
