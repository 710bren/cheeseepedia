## Notes ##

* Features the [1982 Articulated Chuck Walkaround]({{< ref "wiki/1982 Articulated Chuck Walkaround.md" >}}).
* Unlike [Smile America - 30s 1 (Commercial)]({{< ref "wiki/Smile America - 30s 1 (Commercial).md" >}}), this features unique shots not seen in the 60 second version, namely the [Chuck E. Cheese Roller]({{< ref "wiki/Chuck E Cheese Roller.md" >}}) sequence and a mirrored shot of Mr. Munch interacting with a kid.
