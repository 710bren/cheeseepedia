## Notes ##

* Features the [1982 Articulated Chuck Walkaround]({{< ref "wiki/1982 Articulated Chuck Walkaround.md" >}}).
* Unlike Smile America - 30s 1 (Commercial), this features unique shots not seen in the 60 second version, namely the Chuck E. Cheese Roller sequence and a mirrored shot of Mr. Munch interacting with a kid.
