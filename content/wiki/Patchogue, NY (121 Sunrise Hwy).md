**_Patchogue, NY (121 Sunrise Highway)**_ is a _Chuck E. Cheese's_ located in Patchogue, NY. The location opened on March 29, 1993.
##Stages##
This location opened with a [2-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/2-Stage.md" >}}) show. In the early 2000's, the showroom was relocated from the back right-hand corner of the restaurant to the left-hand side of the restaurant which can be seen upon entry. In the process, the existing stage was replaced with a [Studio C Beta]({{< ref "wiki/Studio C Beta.md" >}}).
##History##
The location's first major known renovation was in the early 2000's, when the showroom was swapped with the game room and showroom walls were aptly removed as a result. The location remained mostly untouched until it received the 2015 update package. For an extended period before the update (from 2012), the location did not have awnings. Additionally, an image from 2012 (before the removal) reveals that the location did have tiles across the facade. The sign on the right-hand side of the building included the word 'Pizza' until the update.
