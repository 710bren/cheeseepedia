The <i>Cyberamic Eye Assembly</i>, Part no. 000-0043, is an assembly consisting of a wooden eyeball with a hole drilled in the center, and a A36 carbon steel rod that goes into the hole in the eyeball. The type of wood the eye itself is made out of is unknown. The steel rod also has a smaller metal rod that inserts into the eye to prevent the eye from twisting on the rod.
