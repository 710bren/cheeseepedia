**The King** is a lion character dressed in a style resembling [Elvis Presley]({{< ref "wiki/Elvis Presley.md" >}}). The King was programmed to sing Elvis Presley songs using the original Chuck E Cheese recordings. He was most likely created in honor of Presley, who died the same year Pizza Time Theater opened. He first debuted in 1982. He often made dedications of songs to members of the Pizza Time Players in the main dining area. The outro of each skit would tell the audience to visit the main dining area, take a walk through the Fantasy Forest, or enjoy some pizza. Some stores had the King until 1995, where he would sing original CEC songs. A handful of Kings still survive today, notably four of them owned by Jared, who runs a YouTube channel called The King Robot. Other surviving Kings are in Smitty's Super Service Station, Volo Auto Museum, and Jungle Jim's
