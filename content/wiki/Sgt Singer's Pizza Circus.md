Sgt. Singer's Pizza Circus (styled as 'Sgt. Singer's Spectacular Star Studded Circus Pizza Show') was a pizza place with at least 4 locations, a Kiddieland location, and multiple travelling shows. The concept was operated by [Nickels and Dimes Incorporated]({{< ref "wiki/Nickels and Dimes Incorporated.md" >}}), who also operated the Tilt arcades. The chain offered pizza, beer, animatronic shows, and arcade games for guests to enjoy. While the exact amount of time the chain was active is unknown, newspaper articles helped to give a rough estimate of March 1, 1982 - August 7, 1991. 

## History ##

## Animatronics ##
The chain's main cast consisted of Sgt. Singer the tiger, P. T. Bearum the bear, and Pounce D' Lion the lion. The chain generally had a 3 stage setup and would use other Creative Presentations animatronics for the other stage, generally Patty the Piano-Playing Pachyderm and Mortimer the Mouse on the right stage and Bob Wire and The Boys on the left. Some locations such as the one in Decatur would also use the Ape-Ology's in the center stage later in the store's lifespan.
