{{Showtape|date=Winter 1990|raesvhs=y|image=Neighbors.png}}**_SPP Neighbors - Faith - Dreams**_ is one of the last few showtapes released for _Showbiz Pizza Place's_ hosting the _Rock-afire Explosion_.

For some stores, this was the last tape used before _Concept Unification_ would start at their location. Each tape sent after [SPP Christmas '89 / Wave Bday]({{< ref "wiki/SPP Christmas '89  Wave Bday.md" >}}) would become increasingly more rare as stores would convert to _3-Stages._

Note: It not comfirm to when this show was released but it was sometime between January or February 1990.
