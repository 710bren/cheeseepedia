A **_Bit Chart**_ usually refers to a physical chart describing the names given to a list of numbers representing _animation bits_. 

Each bit represents a character movement, light, or special effect, which can either be in an on or off state. The numbers on the chart correlate with the same list used in the animatronic software, allowing store techs to identify, test, and troubleshoot the animatronic systems. These charts can sometimes be separated into two sections, usually referred to as the **_Top Drawer**_ and **_Bottom Drawer**_. 

Bits are usually grouped by character, but otherwise are indeterminately placed in the chart. The [Cyberamic Control System]({{< ref "wiki/Cyberamic Control System.md" >}}) grouped bits by 'Character Cards', which were circuit boards controlling a single character or set of lights that could be swapped out. Charts don't always reveal all bits available however, such as in the Studio C Bit Chart, which used additional float values for special lights.
