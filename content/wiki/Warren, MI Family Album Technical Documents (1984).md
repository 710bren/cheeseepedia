The 1984 **_Warren, MI Family Album Technical Documents**_ were a set of handwritten documents by an employee going by 'Jimmie' for controlling the [Family Album]({{< ref "wiki/Family Album.md" >}}) stage show at the [Warren, MI (11555 Engleman Rd)]({{< ref "wiki/Warren, MI (11555 Engleman Rd).md" >}}) Pizza Time Theatre.

## Contents ##
The document is a 7 page manual stapled together at the top left corner.

#### Dear 'Yuccys' ####
The fist section is a note from Jimmie to 'Young Up & Coming Controller's' (Yuccy) that describes tips for a better performance. It mainly details preparation before coming into work to decide on which topics to discuss, encouraging employees to bring in their interests, jokes, trivia, and topics the audience can relate to. It also notes to be ready for audience comments during a show.

#### Control Board ####
The second section is a hand-drawn diagram of the control board. Each button is labeled to its function,

#### Starting System ####
The third section shows steps on starting up and shutting down the Family Album system, alongside a hand-drawn diagram of the control rack. Other notable buttons are listed on the drawing.

#### Setting Up A Show ####
The fourth section details inserting a cassette, preparing the program, and playing a show to its completion.

#### Birthdays ####
The fifth section details playing an entire birthday show. The show is done entirely through just the _Mr. Kootch_ character, with mainly adlibbed segments. This is the only show noted that requires multiple other employees to perform, as someone must knock on the door to signal if the pizza is ready, and the Chuck E. mascot must come out after section 2 of the tape.
