This location received Concept Unification in 1991 or 1992, and was converted back into an RAE after they closed, becoming 'Billy Joe's Ice Cream Parlor & Restaurant', which closed in the early 2000's.

They would only have the 3-Stage for a very short time, until 1995, when the would close and were converted back into a RAE as apart of a ice cream parlor and restaurant known as 'Billy Joe's Ice Cream Parlor & Restaurant'. they would only be open until the early 2000's, when they closed, the bots were sold to someone, and sat in a storage unit for a long time, until 2020, when they were found by [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgxzb-fN2B43_3FirF1XDnQ Connor Leschinsky] and [https://www.youtube.com/c/sptproductions/videos Sptproductions].
