<h2>Trivia</h2>
*Most of the intermissions in this show are reused
**The two Charlie Rockit intermissions, 'Chuck E.'s Zoo View' and the footage in countdown 7 are reused from [Let The Good Times Roll]({{< ref "wiki/Let The Good Times Roll.md" >}}). 
** The music in countdown 7 first appeared in [January 1995]({{< ref "wiki/January 1995.md" >}}).
**Countdown 2 reuses footage from [Dance Party 1999]({{< ref "wiki/Dance Party 1999.md" >}}). 
**Countdowns 3 and 5 reuse footage from [January 2001 Show]({{< ref "wiki/January 2001 Show.md" >}}). 
** Super Jasper - 'Resist The Temptation' is reused from [Chuck E's Rockin' Rhymes]({{< ref "wiki/Chuck E's Rockin' Rhymes.md" >}}).
**Countdowns 1 and 6 reuse footage from [September 2001 Show]({{< ref "wiki/September 2001 Show.md" >}}). 
** 'Pasqually's Polka Minute' is reused from January 2002.
** 'Pizza Survivor' is reused from [September 2002 Show]({{< ref "wiki/September 2002 Show.md" >}}).
** VeggieTales - 'Belly Button' is reused from [September 2003 Show]({{< ref "wiki/September 2003 Show.md" >}}).
**Countdown 4 uses the cut footage for 'Going On A Diet' from [September 2004]({{< ref "wiki/September 2004.md" >}}). Also, the instrumental for 'Smile' is used for Countdown 3.
* In segment 3 when the video feed is rebooted, various pieces of footage appear on the screen. All of them are from this show with the exception of two frames from [You're A Star]({{< ref "wiki/You're A Star.md" >}}), those being a shot of Dick Frank in 'Frank's Barber Shop' and stock footage from 'Vacation'. 
*The Studio C DVD contains a version of 'Nobody But Me' live which has text saying '8 Minutes to Showtime!'. This was a mistake and was fixed with a second version of the live which appears at the end of the disc. 'Super Jasper' also appears twice on the disc though there doesn't seem to be any reason why.
*This was the last show programmed by Matt Daniel before leaving the entertainment department and moving to California.
