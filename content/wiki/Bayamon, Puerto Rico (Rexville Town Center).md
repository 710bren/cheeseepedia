## History ##


###### Opening ######
In June 2003, almost 20 years after the Bayam贸n Pizza Time Theater in Santa Rosa Plaza opened in November/December of 1983, a brand-new CEC opened in Bayam贸n, this time located at the then-recently built Rexville Town Center under a completely different franchisee than the one that opened the PTTs in San Juan and Bayam贸n back in 1983. The store opened with the Cool Chuck remodel, which contained poster withs from mostly 1998-2001, as well as some posters from 1993-1995, and a Studio C Beta which included a [Chuck E. Cheese 16m (Animatronic)]({{< ref "wiki/Chuck E Cheese 16m (Animatronic).md" >}}) produced by Garner Holt Productions that was just starting to roll out to new stores.

###### 2000s ######
The store had the [Phase 3 (2000)]({{< ref "wiki/Phase 3 (2000).md" >}}) game package along with [Skytubes]({{< ref "wiki/Skytubes.md" >}}), as well as dim lighting and wall planters. The 16m bot at this time had a Cool Chuck outfit made by Garner Holt (Notice the C on the shirt), which featured a red hat with a black C, a blue shirt with yellow stripes on the sleeves and a big yellow C in the middle, and khaki shorts. The store's walkaround costume was a 01 Chuck walkaround, although some of the colors on the shirt were flipped. Around 2004, the store would receive a long fur Avenger walkaround costume, although at some point later on, it would be replaced by a short fur version of the costume. In 2005, the curtains on the stage would not be programmed on the show tapes but would still work for live shows. The earliest documentation of the walkarounds for the other characters at this store is from 2008, which is when the store would receive a Helen walkaround. That same year, the store would remove all the fake planters on the walls and replaced the 2001 Italy Postcard with a Green Pop Chuck poster.

###### 2010s ######
In 2010, the store replaced the Cool Chuck outfit on their bot with an Avenger outfit.
