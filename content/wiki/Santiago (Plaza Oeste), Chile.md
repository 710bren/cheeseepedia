**_Plaza Oeste (Entrada Mall Plaza Oeste 1510, Cerrillos, Regi√≥n Metropolitana)**_ is a _Chuck E. Cheese's_ which opened on January 2, 2011 with a [1-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/1-Stage.md" >}}) show.

## History: ##
Plaza Oeste, also known as Cerrillos, opened on January 2nd, 2011 with the 05 Remodel. This was the third Chuck E. Cheese's location that opened in Chile. The store layout was identical to most stores being opened around that time with the exception of their stage, being a 1-Stage that was formerly used in Mall Plaza Vespucio, a store that opened in 1996 and closed in 2000.


This was one of the last stores to host [Chuck E. Cheese's Memory Match]({{< ref "wiki/Chuck E Cheese's Memory Match.md" >}}) for a while before being removed. 


Avenger Chuck's walkaround was still rarely used in the store until 2019, as he was trashed during the pandemic.


In 2017 and 2019 the store received new modern games to replace older ones.


In December 2019, the location fixed its exterior including lights, paint and the store sign.

## Stage: ##
The store has a Unique 1-Stage, which has been operating since opening. Chuck E's shorts and Munch's piano front were missing when the store opened but were installed in the following month. The stage uses a [2-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/2-Stage.md" >}}) backdrop but is missing Chuck E's Star, Wink, the Munch Make Believe Band sign, Pasqually's text on the wall and curtains. 


Jasper sits on a real speaker while Pasqually uses a folding chair.
