## History ##

### Opening ###
The first mention of the Florin store would be on July 28th, 1979 for a job listing for the opening staff.<ref>https://www.newspapers.com/image/621381729/?terms=%22Pizza%20Time%20Theatre%22%20%22Florin%22&match=2</ref> The store would open on August 14, 1979.<ref name=':0' />

Some time before December of 1979, Florin Center would change its name to the now Florin Mall. The store would celebrate by displaying a PTT themed taxi in the mall itself, alongside hosting a draw for a $1,000 'Dolli Dimples Party'. Bernice Hing would win the draw and bring in 105 guests for the party.<ref>https://archive.org/details/the-pizza-times-newsletters/1979%20The%20Pizza%20Times%201-1/page/n3/mode/2up?q=florin</ref>

Florin's Assistant Manager Ben Kline would be one of the first to complete Pizza Time Theatre's Management Training Program.<ref>https://archive.org/details/the-pizza-times-newsletters/1979%20The%20Pizza%20Times%201-1/page/n1/mode/2up?q=florin</ref> Another Assistant Manager, Randy Morse, would later become one of the training staff for the program in 1981.

During the opening of [Citrus Heights, CA (7614 Greenback Lane)]({{< ref "wiki/Citrus Heights, CA (7614 Greenback Lane).md" >}}) on December 26, 1979, the District Manager Roger Berke had to deliver pizzas from the Florin location to Cirtus Heights due to the store's gas lines not being turned on yet.<ref>https://archive.org/details/the-pizza-times-newsletters/1980%20The%20Pizza%20Times%202-1/page/n1/mode/2up?q=florin</ref>

### 1980 ###
Some time before May of 1980, Scott Nelson, a former assistant manager for [Concord, CA (1975 Diamond Blvd)]({{< ref "wiki/Concord, CA (1975 Diamond Blvd).md" >}}) during its opening, would be named manager of the Florin Mall location. He would be Pizza Time Theatre's youngest manager at the time- being just 21.<ref>https://archive.org/details/the-pizza-times-newsletters/1980%20The%20Pizza%20Times%202-1/page/n3/mode/2up?q=florin</ref>

### 1983 ###
In early 1983 Florin would receive the award for best performance in the Northern California area for training employees for 1982.<ref>https://archive.org/details/the-pizza-times-newsletters/1983%20The%20Pizza%20Times%203-1/page/n5/mode/2up?q=florin</ref> At the same time Florin alongside Sacramento, CA (7020 Stockton Blvd), Lodi, CA, [Modesto, CA (3037 Sisk Rd)]({{< ref "wiki/Modesto, CA (3037 Sisk Rd).md" >}}), and [Sacramento, CA (1690-96 Arden Way)]({{< ref "wiki/Sacramento, CA (1690-96 Arden Way).md" >}}) would host a dough rolling tournament. It is unknown which store won.

### Closing ###
The store would be held for auction on December 14, 1985 at 10AM. It is unknown if the store had already closed before then.<ref name=':1' />
