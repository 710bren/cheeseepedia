**Baltimore (Essex), MD (8354 Eastern Ave) opened on August 6th of 1991 in the Diamond Point Plaza.**

The outfitting of the location cost $800,000 according to Alice Winters, a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_E._Cheese Showbiz Pizza Time official]. The Location opened with a [Road Stage]({{< ref "wiki/Road Stage.md" >}}) and [Phase 3]({{< ref "wiki/Phase 3.md" >}}) décor, a majority of which would survive until the locations end. The location eventually received a 2 stage at an unknown date around 1992-1993. In the early years Essex had many birthdays and visitors, however it was in a bad area meaning attendance began to lower. Customers and Attendees stated they had lost [https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/retro_pizza_zone/essex-md-has-closed-down-t13500.html phones,]Purses, Wallets and other items of value. In 2018 when Chuck E Cheese closed low earning locations Essex was closed along with other underperforming stores. 

## Stage ##

### Outfits ###
The Essex stage opened as a road stage for about 1-2 years before changing to the ever growing 2 stage. Early footage of the location with the road stage is rare and extremely few and far between. However Chuck was in his  hat outfit as many locations had also used. When the 2 stage was added Chuck retained this outfit until he was switched to his avenger costume. Munch had his hat until the location had closed. 

## Decoration ##
Essex retained a large amount of its phase 3 decorations, such as the photo ride, showroom sign, checkerboard pattern signs and other decorations. Essex was praised often for keeping these even after Rockstar in 2012. Eventually the photo ride was changed to Rockstar chuck around 2014. It kept the red and yellow awning and Phase 3 sign along with many indoor decorations. 

## Closing ##

Essex closed on October 28th of 2018 after CEC chose to close underperforming locations, Essex was included in these closings. Eventually the sign was taken down and décor was removed. Essex became well known for its sign burn on the exterior, it is unknown what happened to the bots however it is likely they were destroyed or used for spare parts. Essex still remains vacant and has been since its closing.

## Diamond Point ##

When Essex opened the plaza's main store was an Ames directly next to it. The Ames was popular and local citizens often bought from there, around the early 2000's the plaza began to fail, eventually the Ames closed in 2002. Chuck E Cheese eventually became the only store in the plaza, as the Ames remained abandoned, temporary small businesses had attempted to set up shop there but they often barely remained for over 2 years. In 2018 when Essex closed the Plaza was left fully vacant. A flea market is held in the parking lot every Saturday-Sunday.
