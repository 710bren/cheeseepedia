<b><i>1036 Bloomington Rd</b></i> was a <i>Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre</i> that opened in 1984 with a [Balcony Stage]({{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage.md" >}}) and closed in December 1990 as a <i>ShowBiz Pizza</i> with [Chuck E.'s House Facade]({{< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House Facade.md" >}}).

<h2> History </h2>
Champaign opened in 1984 with a [Balcony Stage]({{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage.md" >}}). However, almost nothing is known about the store at all. The store would get the 1988 remodel and [Chuck E.'s House Facade]({{< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House Facade.md" >}}) in 1989, and rename the store to ShowBiz Pizza in progress. The store closed in December 1990 for unknown reasons. The store would become many businesses, but today, it remains a 'Bargain Bins' discount store.

The building itself still has some remains of when it used to be open- one of the colored checkers can still be seen on the wall under another layer of plaster, and the 'Now Showing' box remains to this day, although boarded up.




<h2> Stages and Animatronics </h2>
The [Balcony Stage]({{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage.md" >}}) was kept up until 1989, when they retrofitted it to [Chuck E.'s House Facade]({{< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House Facade.md" >}}). The stage would only last a year, as they would close in December 1990.

The store would have most likely opened with Helen Henny as a guest star, and a King Cyberamic in the Lounge.
