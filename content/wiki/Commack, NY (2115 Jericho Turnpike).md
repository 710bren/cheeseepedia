##Stages##

In the process, the existing stage was replaced with a [Studio C Cappa]({{< ref "wiki/Studio C Cappa.md" >}}).
##History##
The location's first major known renovation was in 2005, when the showroom was swapped with the game room and showroom walls were removed as a result.

In 2013, the restaurant was also featured in local news for a brawl that erupted in the [Kid Check]({{< ref "wiki/Kid Check.md" >}}) area.<ref>https://longisland.news12.com/police-brawl-theft-at-commack-chuck-e-cheeses-34750256</ref>

Upon its closure, the location was converted into a Bar Louie. In 2019, the Bar Louie ceased operations; the location is set to become a funeral parlor.<ref>https://libn.com/2021/09/14/former-commack-watering-hole-to-become-funeral-parlor/</ref>
