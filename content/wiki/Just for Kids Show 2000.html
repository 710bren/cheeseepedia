<h2> Trivia: </h2>

* The Studio C Puppets for this show feature white borders around each square for the Studio C Puppets. Helen's is green, Pasqually's is red, Munch is amber, and Jasper is blue.
* This was the final show to feature the Studio C Bluescreen footage. It also seemingly has the Studio C Bluescreen footage leftover from [[Chuck E's Variety Show - Best of 1999|January 2000]].
