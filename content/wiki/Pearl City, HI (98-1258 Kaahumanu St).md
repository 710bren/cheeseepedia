##  History ## 
Pearl City opened on August 7, 1982 as the first CEC in Hawaii. They originally had a [\2](\1). Unfortunately, not a lot of info is known about Pearl City at all, rather than one exterior photo. Around 1989 (month and day unknown), the location closed for unknown reasons. The building was later split up into multiple businesses, which are still on the space. Another CEC opened on Kamehameha Highway by the end of 1994, which is still open today.
