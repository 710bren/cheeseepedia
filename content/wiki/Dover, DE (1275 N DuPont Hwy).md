##  History ## 
Dover opened on December 27, 2002 as the last of 3 [\2](\1) remodel. Around 2005, the location received a minor remodel, removing the [\2](\1) stage. Between 2009 and 2011, the dim lighting was removed and the exterior was replaced with a standard [[2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative]] exterior. The [[Skytubes]] were also removed somewhere presumably in 2019. As of July 2023, Dover remains like this.
