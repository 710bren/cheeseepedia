## History ##
Dover opened on December 27, 2002, as the last of 3 Small-Town Studio C Prototype stages and the [Phase 3]({{< ref "wiki/Phase 3 (2000).md" >}}) remodel. Around 2005, the location received a minor remodel, removing the Small-Town Studio C Prototype stage for a Small-Town Studio C (Studio C Cappa) stage. Between 2009 and 2011, the dim lighting was removed, and the exterior was replaced with a standard [CEC 2005 Remodel Program]({{< ref "wiki/CEC 2005 Remodel Program.md" >}}) exterior. The [Skytubes]({{< ref "wiki/Skytubes.md" >}}) were also removed somewhere presumably in 2019. In 2023, the store received the [CEC 2018 2.0 Remodel Program]({{< ref "wiki/CEC 2018 20 Remodel Program.md" >}}), removing the Cappa for a Chuck E. Live Stage (Dance Floor) (Dance Floor) + [Video Wall]({{< ref "wiki/Video Wall.md" >}}). As of October 2023, Dover remains like this.
