## History ##
Dover opened on December 27, 2002 as the last of 3 Small-Town Studio C Prototype stages and the [Phase 3]({{< ref "wiki/Phase 3 (2000).md" >}}) remodel. Around 2005, the location received a minor remodel, removing the Small-Town Studio C Prototype stage for a Small-Town Studio C (Studio C Cappa) stage. Between 2009 and 2011, the dim lighting was removed and the exterior was replaced with a standard 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative exterior. The [Skytubes]({{< ref "wiki/Skytubes.md" >}}) were also removed somewhere presumably in 2019. As of July 2023, Dover remains like this.
