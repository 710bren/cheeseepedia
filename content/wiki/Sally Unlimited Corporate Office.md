The **_Sally Unlimited Corporate Office (567 Bishop Gate Ln, Jacksonville, FL)**_ was the offices for [[Sally Corporation]] for an unknown amount of years, with the only confirmed dates of residence being February 1979 to July 1980.<ref>https://archive.org/details/commex00unit/page/10/mode/2up?q=%22sally+unlimited%22</ref><ref>https://archive.org/details/TheJerusalemPost1980IsraelEnglish/Jul%2028%201980%2C%20The%20Jerusalem%20Post%2C%20%2314983%2C%20Israel%20%28en%29/page/n13/mode/2up?q=aaaa</ref>

It is unknown if the offices were used for manufacturing, or if this was leased to a separate building. One piece of footage from around the mid 90's shows a small manufacturing room that isn't the corporate office nor the later [[Sally Dark Rides Corporate Office]].<ref>https://youtu.be/KsKsMsXZqik</ref>
