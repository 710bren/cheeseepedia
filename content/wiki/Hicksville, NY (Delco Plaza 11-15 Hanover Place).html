<b><i>Hicksville, NY (Delco Plaza 11-15 Hanover Place), Store #499, </b></i>is a <i>Chuck E. Cheese</i> which opened on January 24, 1994, and is still open to this day with a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/1-Stage" >}}">1-Stage</a>. This location is the second-closest location to the New York metro area to retain its animatronic show, with the closest being the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Nanuet, NY (250 West Route 59)" >}}">Nanuet, NY</a> location, which has a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Studio C Beta" >}}">Studio C Beta</a> stage. In May of 2024, Chuck E. Cheese announced that Hicksville would be one of 5 locations to keep its stage due to the Munch's Make Believe Band Residency|CEC Legacy Location Program.

<h2>Stages</h2>
This location opened with a 1-Stage show right before the finalized version was released. The stage had three screens instead of the usual two or one behind Munch. Chuck originally wore his tuxedo, however in the early 2000s the tuxedo and bowler cap were replaced with the Cool Chuck outfit. They also received Chuck E's avenger cap in 2007 but never received the avenger outfit. In late 2013, Chuck E's avenger cap was removed because of the new rockstar rebranding. Chuck received jeans in 2019, while keeping his Cool Chuck outfit. The stage received lift curtains on July 17th.

<h2>History</h2>
Upon its opening, the location was featured in a CEC Special Report segment, which was included in the showtape <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Let The Good Times Roll" >}}">Let The Good Times Roll</a>.

The restaurant had an initial expansion between 2004 to 2005. The restaurant was expanded again sometime in mid-to-late 2013<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBzzLVYSKBI</ref>, in which it was also fully remodeled, and the entrance was reconfigured. The 2013 expansion utilized space from a Blockbuster Video location which had closed sometime between 2007 to 2011<ref>Google Maps Street View</ref>.

* New masks made for Helen and Jasper.
* A new snout and jaw made for Chuck.
* New lights including inside of Pasqually's drums.
* Tweaking Pasqually's hands to hold drumsticks in a realistic way.
* New plastic feet for Chuck.
* A deep cleaning of the curtains for its 2.0 Remodel. According to Tyler, this would take 9 washes and took about a week. The curtains itself were found under the stage.
