<p><b><i>Hicksville, NY (Delco Plaza 11-15 Hanover Place), Store #499, </b></i>is a <i>Chuck E. Cheese</i> which opened on January 24, 1994, and is still open to this day with a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/1-Stage" >}}">1-Stage</a>. This location is the second-closest location to the New York metro area to retain its animatronic show, with the closest being the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Nanuet, NY (250 West Route 59)" >}}">Nanuet, NY</a> location, which has a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Studio C Beta" >}}">Studio C Beta</a> stage. In May of 2024, Chuck E. Cheese announced that Hicksville would be one of 5 locations to keep its stage due to the Munch's Make Believe Band Residency|CEC Legacy Location Program.</p>
<p><h2>Stages</h2></p>
<p>This location opened with a 1-Stage show right before the finalized version was released. The stage had three screens instead of the usual two or one behind Munch. Chuck originally wore his tuxedo, however in the early 2000s the tuxedo and bowler cap were replaced with the Cool Chuck outfit. They also received Chuck E's avenger cap in 2007 but never received the avenger outfit. In late 2013, Chuck E's avenger cap was removed because of the new rockstar rebranding. Chuck received jeans in 2019, while keeping his Cool Chuck outfit. The stage received lift curtains on July 17th.</p>
