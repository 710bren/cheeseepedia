**_6251 Sunrise Blvd i**_s a Chuck E. Cheese/Showbiz Pizza that opened in August 1983 (day not known), as a franchise location with a Rock-Afire Explosion stage which is still open to this day.

It is located in an unnamed shopping center.

It should not be confused with the [Citrus Heights, CA (7614 Greenback Lane)]({{< ref "wiki/Citrus Heights, CA (7614 Greenback Lane).md" >}}) Pizza Time Theatre location as it opened in January 1980 and closed around 1984 with a Portrait Stage.
##Stages##
Like all Showbiz Pizzas at the time, the store opened with the Rock-Afire Explosion stage.

In 1988-1989, the stage was converted into Chuck E.'s House.

As of February 2023, Citrus Heights (Sunrise) still has the 1-Stage and 2005 Remodel.
##History##
Citrus Heights (Sunrise) opened in August 1983 as a franchise-owned location. Citrus Heights (Sunrise) opened with the Rock-Afire Explosion show, and stripes on the outside and on the inside. Interestingly, it had a unique exterior with Billy Bob on the top of the Showbiz logo. Citrus Heights (Sunrise) received very little bits of the 1988 Remodel in 1988-1989 removing all SPP decor for newer decor, and the conversion of the Rock-Afire Explosion for Chuck E.'s House. [Milwaukee, WI (7401 Good Hope Rd)]({{< ref "wiki/Milwaukee, WI (7401 Good Hope Rd).md" >}}) also did this as well. Around 1991-1992, Citrus Heights (Sunrise) then received the 1988 remodel removing all older decor for newer decor, adding Blue and White awnings above the salad bar, checkers around and outside the store, and the conversion of Chuck E.'s House for the Road Stage. In the late 90's, they replaced the logo with Coach/Cool Chuck and received Phase 2 which removed all older decor for newer decor, removed Blue and White awnings, removed checkers, and added SkyTubes to replace the ball pit. Citrus Heights (Sunrise) remained like this until in 2006-2007, when they received the 2005 remodel which involved the removal of the showroom walls, removing older decor for newer decor, new booths, relocating the stage, & adding purple walls. Citrus Heights (Sunrise) still remains like this though in 2015, their Road Stage was replaced with the 1-Stage. Currently, as of February 2023, the location still has the 2005 Remodel and the 1-Stage.
