<b><i>6251 Sunrise Blvd, Store #329 </b></i> is a <i>Chuck E. Cheese</i> that opened in August 1983 (day not known), as a franchise <i>[ShowBiz Pizza Place]({{< ref "wiki/ShowBiz Pizza Place.md" >}})</i> location with a [Rock-Afire Explosion]({{< ref "wiki/Classic Stage.md" >}}), which is still open to this day. 

It should not be confused with the [Citrus Heights, CA (7614 Greenback Lane)]({{< ref "wiki/Citrus Heights, CA (7614 Greenback Lane).md" >}}) Pizza Time Theatre location, which opened in December 1979 and closed in January 1985 with a Cyberamics Portrait Stage (Portrait Stage).
<h2>History</h2>
Citrus Heights (Sunrise) opened in August 1983 as a franchise-owned location. Citrus Heights (Sunrise) opened with the Rock-Afire Explosion show, and stripes on the outside and the inside. Interestingly, it had a unique exterior with Billy Bob on the top of the Showbiz logo. Citrus Heights (Sunrise) received very little bits of the 1988 Remodel in 1988-1989 removing all SPP decor for newer decor, and the conversion of the Rock-Afire Explosion for Chuck E.'s House. [Milwaukee, WI (7401 Good Hope Rd)]({{< ref "wiki/Milwaukee, WI (7401 Good Hope Rd).md" >}}) also did this as well. (The speakers that went along Rolfe and Billy Bob's stage were left intact.) Around 1991-1992, Citrus Heights (Sunrise) then received the 1988 remodel removing all older decor for newer decor, adding Blue and White awnings above the salad bar, checkers around and outside the store, and the conversion of Chuck E.'s House for the Road Stage. In the late 90's, they replaced the logo with Coach/Cool Chuck and received Phase 2 which removed all older decor for newer decor, removed Blue and White awnings, removed checkers, and added SkyTubes to replace the ball pit. Citrus Heights (Sunrise) remained like this until 2006-2007, when they received the 2005 remodel which involved the removal of the showroom walls, removing older decor for newer decor, new booths, relocating the stage, & adding purple walls. Later in 2015, their Road Stage was replaced with the 1-Stage. The Road Stage speakers, valance and stage platform were left intact. Chuck's outfit was changed from the avenger outfit to the Rockstar outfit with his microphone on his right hand instead of his left hand like other bots. On January 22nd, 2024, the store would remove its 1-Stage and 3-Stage speakers as the store started its CEC 2018 2.0 Remodel Program (refresh remodel). The only thing that would remain from their phase 4 remodel were the booths along with the Trampoline Zone being added. As of August 2024, Citrus Heights, CA is still open with their 2021 Model Dance floor and video wall. 

<h2>Stages</h2>
Like all Showbiz Pizzas at the time, the store opened with the Rock-Afire Explosion stage.

1988-1989, the stage was converted into Chuck E.'s House, which would later be replaced around 1991-1992 for a Road Stage. In 2015, the store would replace its Road Stage with a [1-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/1-Stage.md" >}})

On January 22nd, 2024, the store would remove its [1-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/1-Stage.md" >}}) in favor of its 2.0 Remodel. It was replaced with a Dance Floor + Video Wall a few days later.
