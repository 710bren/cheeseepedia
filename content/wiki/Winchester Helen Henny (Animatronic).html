<h2>History</h2>
<h3> Production </h3>
In August 1977, Pizza Time Theatre had finalized their 'Guest Star' concept with the creation of Helen Henny. They tasked Fantasy Forest with creating the Bot.
<h3> At Winchester </h3>
The Bot was installed at the Pizza Time Theatre on <a href="{{< ref "wiki/San Jose, CA (370 S Winchester Blvd)" >}}">370 S Winchester Blvd.</a> on August 12th, 1977<sup>(1)</sup>. The Bot was installed with the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Helen Henny Showtape" >}}">Helen Henny Showtape</a>. The Bot was replaced in February 1978 when <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Winchester Madam Oink (Animatronic)" >}}">Winchester Madam Oink</a> was installed.
<h3> Fate </h3>
The fate of Winchester Helen is unknown as no photos of The Bot at <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Pizza Time Theatre Sunnyvale, CA Corporate Office" >}}">Sunnyvale</a>, <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Pizza Time Theatre Cupertino, CA Corporate Office" >}}">Cupertino</a>, or any other PTT Corporate location have been found. The Bot is possibly the same as <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Kooser Helen Henny (Animatronic)" >}}">Kooser Helen Henny</a>, as the bots share the same design. The bot was most likely destroyed during the move to the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Showbiz Pizza Time Corporate Office" >}}">Showbiz Pizza Time Corporate Office</a>
<h2>Design</h2>
The Bot had long brown hair, brown eyes, yellow hands with red painted fingernails, a black necklace with a gold medallion, and wears a white shirt with a purple vest over it.
