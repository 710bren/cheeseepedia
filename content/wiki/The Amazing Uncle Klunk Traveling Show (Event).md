## Store Appearances ##
 Store appearances are largely going off of when advertising would show up, and when the '$4.00 Value' coupons would be set to expire. Uncle Klunks could have been installed earlier, or lasted a few days later. Some stores also do not have any coupon date ranges, so will just be marked with the day their citation comes from.
Currently, 19 confirmed stores and 1 potential store have been found to have hosted Klunk out of the 40 Klunks that were sent out for the event.

### July 5th Announcement ###
Newspapers in Florida would have Klunk ads placed in them on July 5th, stating he was 'Coming Soon, Limited Engagement'. [Altamonte Springs, FL (541 W Hwy 436)]({{< ref "wiki/Altamonte Springs, FL (541 W Hwy 436).md" >}}){< ref "wiki/Altamonte Springs, FL (541 W Hwy 436).md" >}}), [Orlando, FL (841 Lee Rd)]({{< ref "wiki/Orlando, FL (841 Lee Rd).md" >}}){< ref "wiki/Orlando, FL (841 Lee Rd).md" >}}), [Orlando, FL (7419 International Dr)]({{< ref "wiki/Orlando, FL (7419 International Dr).md" >}}){< ref "wiki/Orlando, FL (7419 International Dr).md" >}}), [Tampa, FL (12707 Dale Mabry Hwy)]({{< ref "wiki/Tampa, FL (12707 Dale Mabry Hwy).md" >}}){< ref "wiki/Tampa, FL (12707 Dale Mabry Hwy).md" >}}), and [Tampa, FL (1707 E Fowler Ave)]({{< ref "wiki/Tampa, FL (1707 E Fowler Ave).md" >}}){< ref "wiki/Tampa, FL (1707 E Fowler Ave).md" >}}){< ref "wiki/Tampa, FL (1707 E Fowler Ave).md" >}}) would be teased as the first stores.

### July 14th Wave ###
The first stores to potentially open with Klunk were set for July 14th. All of these stores would have their coupons last for 35 days, from July 14 to August 18- with the exception of [Tulsa, OK (7108 S Memorial Dr)]({{< ref "wiki/Tulsa, OK (7108 S Memorial Dr).md" >}}){< ref "wiki/Tulsa, OK (7108 S Memorial Dr).md" >}}), which coupons were only archived up to August 1st, lasting 18 days.

All of these stores have their ads saying 'Showing Now'

### Florida July 16-18 Wave ###
Despite the Florida stores getting announced the earliest, being the only ones to let customers know ahead of time of Klunk's arrival, they wouldn't formally switch advertising to 'Now Showing' until the 16th and 18th of July. All of these stores would also last until August 18th, being a shorter 33 and 31 days of possible time.

Unlike the 14th wave stores, these ads would exclusively say 'Showing Now, Limited Engagement', rather than just 'Showing Now'

### July 22nd Changes ###
Multiple strange changes to the ongoing ads were noticeable on July 22nd.  and [Tampa, FL (1707 E Fowler Ave)]({{< ref "wiki/Tampa, FL (1707 E Fowler Ave).md" >}}) suddenly now have their text go back to 'Coming Soon, Limited Engagement' until the next ad happens. This was likely a mistake in which version of the ad artwork was used. Additionally, [Springfield, MO (700 W Sunshine St)]({{< ref "wiki/Springfield, MO (700 W Sunshine St).md" >}}), [Wichita, KS (2100 N Amidon Ave)]({{< ref "wiki/Wichita, KS (2100 N Amidon Ave).md" >}}), and [Wichita, KS (333 S Armour Dr)]({{< ref "wiki/Wichita, KS (333 S Armour Dr).md" >}}) switch their text from just 'Showing Now' to 'Showing Now, Limited Engagement' like all of the Florida stores.

### July 30th Wave ###
Three stores in Ohio do not get ads until July 30th, but still continue on to August 18th, now only having a 19 day event.

### Undetermined Stores ###
[Davenport, IA (903 E Kimberly Rd)]({{< ref "wiki/Davenport, IA (903 E Kimberly Rd).md" >}}) on August 7th, 1983 claims that '...a new character will be added to the stage performance at ShowBiz in the near future entitled Uncle Klunk'.<ref>https://www.newspapers.com/image/665684553/?clipping_id=55395460&fcfToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJmcmVlLXZpZXctaWQiOjY2NTY4NDU1MywiaWF0IjoxNjk2OTcwNDk0LCJleHAiOjE2OTcwNTY4OTR9.sClG1OZrf2KnRIxRDXP7BAdtVpv1p4YKdgIgIRQHA4Q</ref>
