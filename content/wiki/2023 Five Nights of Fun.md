## History ##

The event was created to line up with the release month of the **_Five Nights at Freddy's**_ movie, set for October 27th- with Chuck E.'s Big Night of Fun scheduled for the exact release date. The company officially acknowledges this intended lineup:<blockquote>'...our brand is naturally being woven into discussions to the nature of the subject material. [The Five Nights at Freddy's Movie] If they are going to mention us, let's give them something to talk about more than what they've been saying' 

-Employee Newsletter</blockquote>This newsletter also acknowledges the event is not in collaboration with Scott Cawthon or Universal Pictures with the movie, and encourages employees to clarify to customers this distinction, while also directing to never directly saying anything about the FNaF brand.

### Controversy ###

Within the same day of the event's initial discovery on October 5th, the FNoF newsletter would leak to large sections of the Five Nights of Freddy's social media sphere, and the events intentions on indirectly using the movie's popularity. This would spark massive discussion of the brand's dubious use of this promotion, alongside resparking talks about the company's handling of animatronics in the [CEC 2018 2.0 Remodel Program]({{< ref "wiki/CEC 2018 20 Remodel Program.md" >}}).<ref>https://twitter.com/uorplefever/status/1710005098892673265</ref><ref>https://twitter.com/Razzbowski/status/1710005888071663859</ref>

Later that exact same day, the company's first official announcement of FNoF would be made on their Instagram account, being of a recreation of the Five Nights at Freddy's movie poster with CEC branded characters.<ref>https://www.instagram.com/p/CyCQkuhuOgn/?hl=en</ref> This would bring the controversy to its height<ref>https://twitter.com/uorplefever/status/1710080434762354808</ref>, being the first direct allusion to the horror franchise since 2018's [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmigYSQMtBI Halloween at the Pizza Time Theatre] animation, which came off as insincere due to the deep connections between the two brands and culture surrounding them.<ref>https://twitter.com/IRISproject__/status/1710268344488661426</ref><ref>https://twitter.com/dreamiamy/status/1710083329297653988</ref>
