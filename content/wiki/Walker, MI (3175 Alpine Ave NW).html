<p><h2> History </h2></p>
<p><h3> Pre SPP/CEC (November 22nd, 1965-1982) </h3></p>
<p>The space that would house the Walker SPP/CEC would open on November 22nd, 1965 as a Kmart Foods Grocery Store which was the former Grocery Store division for Kmart. It would remain as Kmart Foods until it went out of business and then became a Eberhard Grocery Store which was closed by 1982, sometime after, the construction of the Walker Showbiz Pizza Place would begin with the opening occurring in October.</p>
<p><h3> Showbiz Pizza Place & Chuck E. Cheese (October 26th, 1982-1991 & 1991-2002) </h3></p>
<p>Walker opened on October 26th, 1982 as the third Showbiz Pizza Place in Michigan (3rd after <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Southgate, MI (15300 Toledo Rd)" >}}">Southgate</a> & <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Saginaw, MI (5105 Bay Rd)" >}}">Saginaw</a>) as a Corporate owned store. Walker originally featured the Rock-Afire Explosion, as all other Showbiz locations did. they would have it for a few years, until around 1991, when they would receive Concept Unification, where the Rock-Afire Explosion characters were changed to the Chuck E. Cheese characters. In the Mid-Late 1990's, Walker would receive another remodel. The store would remain this way until they closed and relocated to <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Walker, MI (3108 Alpine Ave NW)" >}}">3108 Alpine Ave NW</a> in possibly the former Kids R Us in September 2002; they would open with a Studio C 2000|Studio C 2000, 32m and would have it until 2018 when it was replaced with a 2017 Model <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Chuck E Live Stage (Dance Floor)" >}}">Dance Floor</a> and still operates to this day.</p>
<p><h3> Post CEC (2002-Present) </h3></p>
<p>Sometime after the relocation and closure, the location's exterior along with the former Kmart next to it would be redone beyond recognition and converted into a Shopping Plaza called 'Summit Alpine'. As of May 2023, Summit Alpine still operates to this day.</p>
<p><h2> Stages </h2></p>
<p>Originally, Walker featured a Rock-Afire Explosion, as all other Showbiz locations did. In 1991, they would undergo Concept Unification, turning the Rock-Afire Explosion into the 3-Stage.</p>
<p>Walker would have the 3-Stage until 2002 (Possibly Late August-Early September) when the 3-Stage was removed due to the location permanently closing and relocating across the street.</p>
