## History ##
Luigi originally came from the [Cincinnati, OH (11400 Princeton Pike)]({{< ref "wiki/Cincinnati, OH (11400 Princeton Pike).md" >}}) Pizza Time Theatre and was bought by Jungle Jim's after the location closed in the Fall of 1984. Luigi was first installed in 1995 in a stand in the Italy section of 'International Foods' his stand was labeled as 'Luigi the Italian Chef' being made all out of wood with a small roof over the Cyberamic. Cosmetically speaking Luigi's mask was reused from when he was at [Cincinnati, OH (11400 Princeton Pike)]({{< ref "wiki/Cincinnati, OH (11400 Princeton Pike).md" >}}) Pizza Time Theatre. His hat was replaced with a much bigger hat that would cover the entire width of his head. For his outfit he wore white shirt with a blue bandana. 

Luigi was replaced between 2002 - 2004 with Pedro who despite seemingly being the same character was a vastly different character mechanically.
