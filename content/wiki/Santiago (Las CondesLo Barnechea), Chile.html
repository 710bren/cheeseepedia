<p><b>Av. San Josemaría Escrivá de Balaguer 12352, Lo Barnechea</b> is a Chuck E. Cheese's that opened in Fall 1994 with a 1-Stage, which is still open to this day.</p>
<p>This location was the first location opened in the country of Chile, as well as being the oldest currently. They are also the only other 1-Stage outside of the United States, with <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Santiago (Plaza Oeste), Chile" >}}">Plaza Oeste</a>, which is also in Chile, being the other.</p>

<p>Originally when the store opened, they had a 1-Stage, which also had a turntable, though it would be removed later on. Currently as of October 2022, they still have the 1-Stage, where Chuck E. wears his Avenger outfit with his hat, the animatronics are also in poor condition, and there is also no Wink. Lo Barnechea is one of two 1-Stages outside the United States, with <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Santiago (Plaza Oeste), Chile" >}}">Santiago (Plaza Oeste)</a>, which is also in Chile, being the other.</p>
