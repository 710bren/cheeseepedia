<b>Av. San Josemaría Escrivá de Balaguer 12352, Lo Barnechea</b> is a Chuck E. Cheese's that opened in Fall 1994 with a 1-Stage, which is still open to this day.

<h2> Stages </h2>
Originally when the store opened, they had a 1-Stage, which also had a turntable, though it would be removed later on. Currently as of October 2022, they still have the 1-Stage, where Chuck E. wears his Avenger outfit with his hat, the animatronics are also in poor condition, and there is also no Wink. Lo Barnechea is one of two 1-Stages outside the United States, with <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Santiago (Plaza Oeste), Chile" >}}">Santiago (Plaza Oeste)</a>, which is also in Chile, being the other.
