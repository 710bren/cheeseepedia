<b><i>5 Cracker Barrel Dr or 'Barboursville</b></i>' is a [Billy Bob's Wonderland]({{< ref "wiki/Billy Bob's Wonderland.md" >}}) location in Barboursville, West Virginia, and is currently the only location of the franchise. It opened in 2003 around the time when the other two locations, [East Barboursville]({{< ref "wiki/Barboursville, WV (3419 US Rt 60).md" >}}) and Ashland, KY (12862 KY Rd. 180) (Ashland, KY) locations closed.

<h2>History</h2>
The current Billy Bob's Wonderland would open in 2003 after the closure of the [East Barboursville]({{< ref "wiki/Barboursville, WV (3419 US Rt 60).md" >}}) (Which was a former Showbiz Pizza Place) and Ashland, KY (12862 KY Rd. 180) (Ashland, KY) locations. The store would open with even more arcade games, a mini-golf course, and laser tag which wasn't possible to fit in at the former two locations. 

<h2>=Relationship with Creative Engineering/Aaron Fechter</h2>=
In 2013, Aaron Fechter attempted to restore the show, but, according to Aaron, Rex was very rude toward him, and he has never returned since. He only ever posted [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IFQbLxlJk one video] from Billy Bob's Wonderland which was posted two years after the fact, that showed the condition of Mitzi's valves which were then covered with bubbling water.

In mid 2023, Billy Bob's would go under new management, which has caused many changes to the store and the company itself. One of these changes, announced in November 2023, was a partnership between Billy Bob's Wonderland and Aaron Fechter, where new licensed merchandise would be created. In a [https://twitter.com/rockafire/status/1727218718336262471 recent Tweet] to Aaron, it was also confirmed that the Rock-afire show would receive work to it. Part of the agreement between BBWL and Aaron would be that the show would be restricted to 'Genuine Creative Engineering' shows, meaning custom shows may no longer be played on the show anymore.

<h2>=Past Restorations</h2>=
Around 2014-2015, David Ferguson, known for DSF Robots and Goofy Gas Fillin' Station, came to restore the show. Most of the broken movements were repaired, the previous show controller was replaced with David's signature Blue Box, and the cosmetics were also replaced. Though the show did get fixed, most of the parts and cosmetics were aftermarket and did not last very long (this was mainly caused by air pressure being too high, which caused the animatronics' masks to melt and some movements to break.)

In 2019, the show was in very poor condition, with deteriorating masks, and broken movements. Mitzi had a broken arm, Beach Bear wore a walkaround head, and Looney Bird was nonfunctional. The show went through a mechanical and cosmetic restoration by Braylon Giles and Anthony Ybarra until they were fired later that year. After they had been fired, the show began to deteriorate in condition yet again.

In late 2020, center stage was entirely shut down, to give the left and right stages more air pressure, Around this time, Beach Bear was covered with a garbage bag to preserve the bot from deterioration.
<h2>=Braylon's Restoration</h2>=
In late 2021, Braylon was hired again, to now attempt a restoration on the full restoration of the show, with changes made such as changing the character's positions on stage to be more accurate to the original, and adding artificial turf to the stage to also match an original show. Restoration was completed in February 2022, being unveiled to the public at one of two conventions the store has held, the other being in July of the same year.
<h2>=Current State</h2>=
In December 2022, Braylon was fired again/left after disagreements with Rex, and supposed stealing of items. He took the masks molds with him, due to the fact he created them, meaning it is likely the characters' masks will continue to deteriorate since he wouldn't be making any new masks for when cracks or rips occur.

Since his absence and to this day, the show has started to lower in condition slightly, though the current employees have been trying their best to fix them, such as in March 2023, Fatz's arm welds broke, leaking them to be non-functional, now being fixed. In addition, the masks have also started to fall apart slightly too, with visible cracks being around the mouth joints of a few of the characters, most noticeably Billy Bob and Dook. Not long after that, Mitzi's outfit was converted back to her default one.
<h2>Extra Shows</h2>
In addition to the main show at their current location, Billy Bob's Wonderland also has two extra shows inside trailers near the building, which originated from the previous locations in Ashland and Barboursville. In addition, they also acquired the [Parkersburg, WV (3500 Murdoch Ave)]({{< ref "wiki/Parkersburg, WV (3500 Murdoch Ave).md" >}}) location's 3-stage after their closure in 1998. Currently, their show uses a combination of East Barboursville's and Ashland's shows, with Parkersburg being used for extra parts.
