<b><i>936 Fairlawn Ave, Store #87</b></i> is a <i>Showbiz Pizza/Chuck E. Cheese</i> that opened on October 27, 1982 as a corporate <i>ShowBiz Pizza Place</i> with a [[Classic Stage|Rock-Afire Explosion]] which is still open to this day. It is located in the Laurel Shopping Center. It was also one of the last locations to have a blue plastic masked Pizzacam before the 2.0 remodel. It is also known as the only Showbiz Pizza in Maryland.
<h2>History</h2>
Laurel opened its doors in October 27th, 1982 with a Rock-afire Explosion show. It was originally and currently a corporate-owned store. Like many other ShowBiz Pizza locations, it had a typical SPP layout seen in many other stores across the United States and would eventually receive the 1988 remodel years after it would open. Although some little documentation exists back in the ShowBiz days, it can be determined that Laurel was one of several locations to receive an Uncle Klunk show package (and a Santa Claus retrofit package as well) sometime after opening. Like many ShowBiz locations in the late 1980s, Laurel received the Showbiz Pizza Campground upgrade.

In around 1991, Laurel received Concept Unification which converted the show to Munch's Make Believe Band. In around the Mid-Late 1990's, Laurel received either [[Phase 1 (1994)|Phase 1]] or [[Phase 2 (1997)|Phase 2]] remodel which removed some early 90's decor and added new decor and SkyTubes. Laurel remained this way until 2005-06 when they received the 2005 Remodel which involved removing the Showroom Walls, balcony Seating, received a new exterior, got an expansion, and also removing some older 90's decor. In June 2022, they received the 2.0 remodel which removed the 3-Stage for the Dance Floor. As of January 2023, they still have the Dance Floor. This store was notable for having the last blue Pizzacam before receiving 2.0.
<h2> Stages</h2>
Laurel opened with the Rock afire Explosion in October 1982. Unfortunately, there are no photos or no videos to exist of Laurel with the Rock afire, or as a ShowBiz in general.

In 1991, Laurel received [Concept Unification]({{< ref "wiki/Concept Unification.html" >}}), converting the Rock afire into Munchâ€™s Make Believe Band.

In June 2022, Laurel received 2.0 and removed the 3-Stage for the Dance Floor although being collected by SPT Distribution.
