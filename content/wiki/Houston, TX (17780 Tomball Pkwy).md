<b><i>Houston, TX (17780 Tomball Pkwy), Store #585</b></i>, otherwise referred to as <b><i>Willowbrook</b></i>, is a <i>Chuck E. Cheese's</i> that opened on November 10, 2006 with a [Studio C Beta]({{< ref "wiki/Studio C Beta.md" >}}) stage.

This store is a possible relocation of [the store at Inwood]({{< ref "wiki/Houston, TX (6760 Antoine Dr).md" >}}), which opened in July 1981 as a <i>Showbiz Pizza Place</i> and closed in September 2006 with a [3-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/Concept Unification Stage.md" >}}).

<h2>Stages</h2>
When the store opened in 2006, it featured a Studio C Beta stage with a Chuck E. Cheese 16m (Animatronic) (16-movement bot). By 2013, the animatronic would have its outfit replaced with the Rockstar outfit. This would remain this way until the store's remodel; when the store received 2.0, the stage's backdrop was removed first<ref>[https:<i>www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1JR8Od149Y&pp=ygUeY2h1Y2sgZSBjaGVlc2UgaG91c3RvbiB0b21iYWxs https:</i>www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1JR8Od149Y]</ref> before the entire stage's eventual removal by mid-July 2019.

<h2>History</h2>

<h2>=Pre-CEC</h2>=
The site of this store was built with 17,184 square feet of space in 1997 as a Just for Feet shoe store,<ref>https:<i>www.xome.com/realestate/17780-state-highway-249-houston-tx-77064-125033852</ref><ref>https:</i>homemetry.com/house/17780+STATE+HIGHWAY+249,+Houston+TX</ref> which opened sometime around that time and most likely closed around 2004. Around early to mid 2006, the site of the former shoe store would be bought by CEC, alongside Vista, CA (1861 University Dr) (the Vista location).

<h2>=Opening</h2>=
On November 10th, 2006, the store would open its doors with the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative (2005 Remodel). There's not much information about the store, as there weren't much minor remodels asides from new game packages over the years throughout the store's history.

<h2>=2.0 Remodel</h2>=
Around July 2019, the store would start their 2.0 remodel, removing the animatronic stage and adding a 2019 model dance floor. The store would then host its grand reopening on September 5th, 2019.<ref>https://www.facebook.com/events/2595145740516079/</ref> Around February 2023, the store would add a [Video Wall]({{< ref "wiki/Video Wall.md" >}}) and replace its Chuck E. Live Stage (Dance Floor) (dance floor) with a 2021 Model version of it.
