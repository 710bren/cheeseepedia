**_Houston, TX (17780 Tomball Pkwy)**_ **_Store #585**_ is a Chuck E. Cheese's that opened on November 10th, 2006 with a Studio C Beta stage.

This store is a possible relocation of [\2](\1), which opened in July 1981 as a _Showbiz Pizza Place_ and closed in September 2006 with a [\2](\1).

## Stages## 
When the store opened in 2006, it featured a [\2](\1) with a [\2](\1). By 2013, the animatronic would have its outfit replcaed with the Rockstar outfit. This would remain this way until the store's remodel; when the store received 2.0, the stage's backdrop was removed first<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1JR8Od149Y&pp=ygUeY2h1Y2sgZSBjaGVlc2UgaG91c3RvbiB0b21iYWxs https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1JR8Od149Y]</ref> before the entire stage's eventual removal by mid-July 2019.

## History## 

### Pre-CEC### 
The site of this store was built with 17,184 square feet of space in 1997 as a Just for Feet shoe store,<ref>https://www.xome.com/realestate/17780-state-highway-249-houston-tx-77064-125033852</ref><ref>https://homemetry.com/house/17780+STATE+HIGHWAY+249,+Houston+TX</ref> which opened sometime around that time and most likely closed around 2004. Around early to mid 2006, the site of the former shoe store would be bought by CEC, alongside [\2](\1).

### Opening### 
On November 10th, 2006, the store would open its doors with the [\2](\1). There's not much information about the store, as there weren't much minor remodels asides from new game packages over the years throughout the store's history.

### 2.0 Remodel### 
Around July 2019, the store would start their 2.0 remodel, removing the animatronic stage and adding a 2019 model dance floor. The store would then host its grand reopening on September 5th, 2019.<ref>https://www.facebook.com/events/2595145740516079/</ref> Around February 2023, the store would add a [\2](\1) with a 2021 Model version of it.
