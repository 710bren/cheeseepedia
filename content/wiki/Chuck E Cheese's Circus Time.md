**_Chuck E. Cheese's Circus Time**_ was a custom _Chuck E. Cheese_ branded version of _The Original Bimbo 3 Ring Circus_ machine from _United Billiards._

## Design ##
A lot of cabinet variants were produced for the original Bimbo machine, with the Chuck E. version taking more cues from the wood paneled versions. While the Bimbo cabinets had a painted background, including the custom _The Original Luigi Pizza Man_ variant, the Chuck E. cabinet only featured a red curtain covering the inner walls. The marionette was replaced with a 1978 Chuck E. Cheese plush, removing the original features that had the marionette move its mouth and head randomly during the show.

The marquee was completely replaced with a brand new Chuck E. variant, displaying _Chuck E. Cheese's Circus Time_ along the top, a nod to its original circus variant.
