**_4145 SW 110th Ave, Store #3169/214**_ is a _Chuck E. Cheese's_ that opened in January 2003 (day unknown) with a Studio C 2000 (Studio C Beta, 32m) and is still open today with the CEC 2018 2.0 Remodel Program (2.0 Remodel).

This was the relocation of the [4445 SW 110th Ave]({{< ref "wiki/Beaverton, OR (4445 SW 110th Ave).md" >}}) location, which opened in September 1990 (day unknown) and relocated here in January 2003 (day unknown) with [Chuck E.'s House]({{< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House.md" >}}). This location is also not to be confused with the [11753 SW Beaverton Hillsdale]({{< ref "wiki/Beaverton, OR (11753 SW Beaverton Hillsdale).md" >}}) location, which opened in October 1981 (day unknown) and closed in July 1985 (day unknown) with a [Balcony Stage]({{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage.md" >}}).

## Stage ##
Beaverton opened with a Studio C 2000 (Studio C Beta, 32m) stage. Around 2005, the curtains were disabled. In 2013, Chuck's cap was removed. By September 19, 2022, the bot was only programmed to random movements. On July 16, 2024, the stage would be removed in favor of the storeâ€™s CEC 2018 2.0 Remodel Program (2.0 Remodel) with the Video Wall and the Dance Floor.

## History ##
Beaverton opened in January 2003 (day unknown) as a relocation of the _4445 SW 110th Ave_ location. It originally had [Phase 3]({{< ref "wiki/Phase 3 (2000).md" >}}), which included some early 2000s decor, [Skytubes]({{< ref "wiki/Skytubes.md" >}}), and a Studio C 2000 (Studio C Beta, 32m). In the late 2000s, they received the 2005 update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative, which involved removing most 90s decor for new decor, replaced the lighting, and added purple walls. The exterior only received minor changes. Around 2016/2017, the exterior was half-changed to the 2015 logo, but the letters stayed the same. They later received a lot of 2.0 artwork but did not receive the full remodel. On January 30, 2023, the store was bought by corporate. On July 16, 2024, the store would begin its CEC 2018 2.0 Remodel Program (2.0 Remodel), removing its stage on the same day, which is how the store stands to this day with its refresh.
