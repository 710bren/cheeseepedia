<h2> History </h2>
This location opened February of 1992 with a Road Stage, 
In the mid 1990s they would replace the stage with a 2-Stage most likely salvaging the animatronics from the Road Stage,
They also most likely got a remodel during this time, and probably got a remodel in the early 2000s.

By 2007, the location had already received the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/CEC 2005 Remodel Program" >}}">CEC 2005 Remodel Program</a> and got an expansion around October 2011 that was completed by June 2012.

In May 2024, they began the 2.0 Remodel in the interior and later the exterior by May 26th, 2024.
