**_5000 Shelbyville Rd**_, also known as **_Mall St. Matthews**_ or **_St. Matthews**_ was a Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre that opened in 1984 (day and month unknown) with a [Cyberamics Balcony Stage]({{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage.md" >}}){< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage.md" >}}){< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage.md" >}}){< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage.md" >}}) and closed on December 1st, 1991 with a [Chuck E.'s House Facade]({{< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House Facade.md" >}}){< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House Facade.md" >}}){< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House Facade.md" >}}){< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House Facade.md" >}}). This store notably was one of few stores to open during 1984, as the company was closing stores that didn't do well, due to bankruptcy.

This was the 2nd store in Louisville, opened after  in July 1982. This was also possibly the 3rd location in Kentucky overall.
## History ##
### Pre-PTT Era (1962-1984) ###
In 1962, when the mall first opened, the space was probably some shops, until 1984, when Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre took the space over.
### PTT Era (1984-1991) ###
In 1984, this store would host it's grand opening celebration, as the second ever Pizza Time Theatre in Louisville. This location, when it opened, was incredibly popular, and was partially responsible for  losing much of it's business in the following years. According to the store manager, this store would host over 100 birthday parties a week. This store was a standard Pizza Time Theatre, having most features any other would have, such as wood paneling around counters and salad bars, signage, arcade games, menu items, and the [Cyberamics Balcony Stage]({{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage.md" >}}){< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage.md" >}}){< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage.md" >}}). this store would notably also have no guest stars, as they were retired by the time the store opened. This store would likely keep this remodel, as it is completely unknown if they would ever go through the [1986 SPT Remodel Program]({{< ref "wiki/1986 SPT Remodel Program.md" >}}) process, as nothing from that era has surfaced.

In the late 1980s, this store would install a [Chuck E.'s House Facade]({{< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House Facade.md" >}}){< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House Facade.md" >}}){< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House Facade.md" >}}) and remove the [Cyberamics Balcony Stage]({{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage.md" >}}){< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage.md" >}}) for good. This would be the final modification the store would ever receive, as they would close a few years later.

On December 1st, 1991, this store would have it's final day, and permanently close for good. The people who ran the store rescheduled every birthday party at the store to be hosted at . This would make that store much more successful, until they would also close in late 1997. The store employees also gave directions to the other store.
### Post-PTT Era (1991-Present) ###
In the coming years of this store's closure, it would become many businesses, with it being gutted. The spot is roughly where Auntie Anne's and Bath & Body Works are now.
## Stages ##
