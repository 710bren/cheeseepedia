**_Redwood City, CA (380 Convention Way) (**_also known as **_San Mateo**_) was a two-story [Pizza Time Theatre]({{< ref "wiki/Pizza Time Theatre.md" >}}) location that opened in August of 1981, and closed in February of 1986<ref>https://archive.org/details/the-pizza-times-newsletters/1981%20The%20Pizza%20Times%201-2/page/n1/mode/2up?q=redwood</ref><ref name=':0'>https://www.newspapers.com/clip/32795765/redwood-city-auction/</ref>

This is not to be confused with the [current location]({{< ref "wiki/Redwood City, CA (2541-43 El Camino Real).md" >}}) which opened on December 28th, 1999, with a Studio C (1997) (Studio C Alpha). As of April 2023, that location is still operational.

## Stages ##
The store would open with [Cyberamics]({{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics.md" >}}) on the Balcony Stage. [Dolli Dimples]({{< ref "wiki/Dolli Dimples (Cabaret).md" >}}) is also confirmed to have been at the location.<ref name=':1'>https://forums.arcade-museum.com/threads/mid-1980s-chuck-e-cheese-pizza-time-theater-animatronics.356457/</ref>

## History ##
RSKT, Inc., franchisee of the [Sunnyvale, CA (1247 W El Camino Real)]({{< ref "wiki/Sunnyvale, CA (1247 W El Camino Real).md" >}}) and Milpitas, CA (346 S Abel St) locations would open Redwood City as their third franchise in August of 1981.<ref>https://archive.org/details/the-pizza-times-newsletters/1981%20The%20Pizza%20Times%201-1/page/n1/mode/2up?q=redwood</ref>

In Summer of 1982, the location's CEC Mascot would present with Donna Clark, Miss Redwood City of 1982, a proclamation of 'Chuck E. Cheese Day' for the city of Redwood on an uncited day.<ref>https://archive.org/details/the-pizza-times-newsletters/1982%20The%20Pizza%20Times%202-2/page/n1/mode/2up</ref>

### Angel Island Run ###
On May 7, 1983, the location would sponsor the _12th Annual Angel Island Run_ to help raise money for underprivileged children. Over 1,500 participants would run the 4.8-mile race along an island in San Francisco Bay. Multiple corporate members would attend the event:

* Marketing: Pat Saign, Don Schulte
* Finance: Steve Merchant
* Wardrobe: Tine Ahmann
* Graphics: Karen Mitchell

Don Schulte would run the race in a Chuck E. Cheese mascot costume, clocking in at 44 minutes, ahead of most other runners. Other costume characters would greet people on the island, whether in the race or not. A 30-foot inflatable Chuck E. Cheese was set up on a hill in the island, visible to passing sailboats.<ref>https://archive.org/details/the-pizza-times-newsletters/1983%20The%20Pizza%20Times%203-2/page/2/mode/2up?q=redwood</ref>

### Auction ###
The location would hold a closing auction on February 8, 1986, at 10AM.<ref name=':0' /> The auction would sell 'Video Games, Kiddie Rides, Amusements, Cyberamics System, Like-New Restaurant Equipment'. An unknown buyer would confirm to have bought Chuck E. Cheese, Helen Henny, Pasqually, Munch, heads of Madam Oink, Harmony Howlette, and Dolli Dimples, a Cyberamics Control Center, a box of controller cards, signage, the Clapper Board, and the Band Board. These would later go up for auction again in the 2010's. _80's Girl / Kobun37_ would get the Chuck E. Cheese Cyberamic, and the rest sent with Damon E. Breland.<ref name=':1' />
