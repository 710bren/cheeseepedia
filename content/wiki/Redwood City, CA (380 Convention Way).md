<h2>= Angel Island Run </h2>=
On May 7, 1983, the location would sponsor the <i>12th Annual Angel Island Run</i> to help raise money for underprivileged children. Over 1,500 participants would run the 4.8-mile race along an island in San Francisco Bay. Multiple corporate members would attend the event:

* Marketing: Pat Saign, Don Schulte
* Finance: Steve Merchant
* Wardrobe: Tine Ahmann
* Graphics: Karen Mitchell

Don Schulte would run the race in a Chuck E. Cheese mascot costume, clocking in at 44 minutes, ahead of most other runners. Other costume characters would greet people on the island, whether in the race or not. A 30-foot inflatable Chuck E. Cheese was set up on a hill in the island, visible to passing sailboats.<ref>https://archive.org/details/the-pizza-times-newsletters/1983%20The%20Pizza%20Times%203-2/page/2/mode/2up?q=redwood</ref>
