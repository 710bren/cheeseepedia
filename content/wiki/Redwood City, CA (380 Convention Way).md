### Angel Island Run ###
On May 7, 1983, the location would sponsor the _12th Annual Angel Island Run_ to help raise money for underprivileged children. Over 1,500 participants would run the 4.8 mile race along an island in San Francisco Bay. Multiple corporate members would attend the event:

* Marketing: Pat Saign, Don Schulte
* Finance: Steve Merchant
* Wardrobe: Tine Ahmann
* Graphics: Karen Mitchell

Don Schulte would run the race in a Chuck E. Cheese mascot costume, clocking in at 44 minutes, ahead of most other runners. Other costume characters would greet people on the island, whether in the race or not. A 30-foot inflatable Chuck E. Cheese was set up on a hill in the island, visible to passing sailboats.<ref>https://archive.org/details/the-pizza-times-newsletters/1983%20The%20Pizza%20Times%203-2/page/2/mode/2up?q=redwood</ref>
