{{Stub}}

**_Columbus, OH (3631 Soldano Blvd)**_ is a Chuck E. Cheese that opened on November 24, 1992 with a [1-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/1-Stage.md" >}}). It is still open today with a [Chuck E. Live Stage (Dance Floor)]({{< ref "wiki/Chuck E Live Stage (Dance Floor).md" >}}) and [Video Wall]({{< ref "wiki/Video Wall.md" >}}).

It was the second location to ever install a 1-Stage and would keep the stage until its remodel in 2022.
