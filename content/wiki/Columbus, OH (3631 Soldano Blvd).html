<p><h2> History </h2></p>
<p>Columbus (Soldano) would open up on November 24, 1992 with the second 1-Stage ever installed. They were also one of the first stores to open with the  <a href="{{< ref "wiki/SPT 1992 Remodel Program" >}}">1990s remodel</a>. The store would basically stay the same throughout the 90s, although would get Coach signage at some point within the decade.</p>
<p>In 2006, Soldano would recieve the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/CEC 2005 Remodel Program" >}}">CEC 2005 Remodel Program</a>, changing out all 90s decor for newer decor, and getting new signage and lettering on the exterior. They would expand in 2011, pushing more space into the back of the store, which relocated the stage to the new back wall of the store.</p>
<p>The store would stay the same until their <a href="{{< ref "wiki/CEC 2018 20 Remodel Program" >}}">CEC 2018 2.0 Remodel Program</a>, where the 1-Stage would be removed for a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Chuck E Live Stage (Dance Floor)" >}}">Dance Floor</a> and <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Video Wall" >}}">Video Wall</a>, and older decor and the exterior would be changed.</p>
<p>As of 2024, the store still remains in this form.</p>
