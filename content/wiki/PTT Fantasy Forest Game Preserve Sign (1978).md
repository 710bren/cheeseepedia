The first **_Pizza Time Theatre Fantasy Forest Game Preserve**_ sign first appeared at the second Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre on 1371 Kooser Road, placed at the main Fantasy Forest Game Preserve entrance from the stores opening (1978) to presumably the installation of the first Balcony stage, or 1981 remodel.

## Production ##
Similar to the smaller, black counterpart, not much is known about the production of the sign. We can theorize it was made between January 1978 through November 1978, although we do not have a definitive answer. 

## Usage/Releases ##

The only known information about this sign comes from the Topeka Inn Management flyer, before Bob Brock ventured with Creative Engineering. Outside of Kooser, no other instance of this sign is known. 

## Design ##
Opposed to the smaller counterpart showcased in the October 1979 Issue of Food Service Marketing magazine, this design follows the theming of the Fantasy Forest, mimicking a bush with 'Chuck E. Cheese's Fantasy Forest Game Preserve' text in the standard Pizza Time Theatre font laid on the sign.
