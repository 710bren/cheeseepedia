**_Sun**_ is one of the prop characters in the [[Rock-afire Explosion]], having made his debut as an animatronic at [[Jacksonville, FL (9820 Atlantic Blvd)]].

##  History ## 

###  Origins & Showbiz Pizza Place ### 
Sun is most commonly depicted with a masculine posh voice courtesy of Burt Wilson, but in the intro segment to the show 'School Days' they are depicted with a feminine voice. Sun was retrofitted into [[Building]] during [[Concept Unification]].

###  Present Day ### 
Original parts for Sun would start to be reproduced by Creative Engineering's new employees in 2023.
