The **_Animatronic Programming System (APS)**_ was a collection of software created by David Philipson for Chuck E. Cheese corporate in the early 90's. This would be used by the Entertainment department as the new way for creating and synching animatronic movements to their video productions. Notably this began around the time Concept Unification was being integrated into stores, making this software all-encompassing for handling the 3-Stage's [Greybox]({{< ref "wiki/Greybox.md" >}}), the Cabaret's [Cyberamic Control System]({{< ref "wiki/Cyberamic Control System.md" >}}), and the newer Cyberamic SVHS stage controllers in one package.
