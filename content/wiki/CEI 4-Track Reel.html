The <b><i>CEI 4-Track Reel</b></i> is the format of the Reel to Reels that CEI produced and sent to stores that contains the audio and data to a showtape.

These showtapes usually have the audio DBX Encoded and the stores usually have a DBX Decoder to Decode the audio. The signals on the reel will require waveshaping to properly work with a Gray Box and a [Layton Bit Stripper]({{< ref "wiki/Layton Bit Stripper.html" >}}) (Built in).

<h2> Format </h2>
The 4 Track Format is below.

# The First Track contains the Showtape Audio Left Channel. This Audio is usually DBX Encoded and requires DBX Decoding.
# The Second Track contains the Showtape Audio Right Channel. This Audio is usually DBX Encoded and requires DBX Decoding.
# The Third Track contains [[Pianocorder Data Format|Pianocorder Formatted]] [Biphase Mark Code]({{< ref "wiki/Biphase Mark Code.html" >}}) Data. This data is for the Top Drawer and to play correctly requires a waveshaper.
# The Fourth Track contains [[Pianocorder Data Format|Pianocorder Formatted]] [Biphase Mark Code]({{< ref "wiki/Biphase Mark Code.html" >}}) Data. This data is for the Bottom Drawer and to play correctly requires a waveshaper.

<h2> Baking </h2>
CEI reels come from Ampex, and are notorious for having [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sticky-shed_syndrome Sticky-Shed Syndrome]. This requires them to have their moisture absorbed before playback- otherwise the tape will be damaged. Attempting to play an unbaked reel will produce an audible squeaking sound.

Baking a tape can either be done in a convection oven or a dehydrator. The temperature should be between 130 °F to 140 °F. Reels should bake for at least 4 hours, but will have better results when done longer. Some users bake for up to 24 hours. Multiple tapes can be baked without changing bake time.

Tapes should be left out for a while before playing them. At minimum this should be 8 hours but most users wait an entire day. Depending on the moisture of the tape's storage, the tape will last a few weeks to a few months before being needed to be baked again.<ref>https:<i>www.tapeheads.net/threads/ampex-tape-baking-how-long-temperture.88891/</ref><ref>https:</i>en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sticky-shed_syndrome</ref>
