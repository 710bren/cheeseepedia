<b><i>Houston, TX (2220 FM 1960), Store #32</b></i> was a <i>Showbiz Pizza Place</i>/<i>Chuck E. Cheese's</i> which opened on June 25th, 1981 as a Showbiz Pizza Place and closed/relocated as a Chuck E Cheese's on August 26th, 2018.

It originally opened as a Showbiz Pizza Place and was located in the at the corner of FM 1960 and Kuykendahl Rd in the Northgate Shopping Center.

<h2>Stages</h2>
When this location first opened, it featured <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Classic Stage" >}}">the Rock-afire Explosion stage</a>, receiving <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Concept Unification" >}}">Concept Unification</a> sometime around 1991/1992.

Around 2009-2010, when the store remodeled again, the stage was replaced with a Studio C 2000 stage featuring a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Chuck E Cheese 16m (Animatronic)" >}}">16-movement bot</a>. As the store's closure date neared in August 2018, the animatronic bot would lose his teeth,<ref>https://youtu.be/pENKwPx3BLs</ref> remaining up to the closure of the store.

<h2>History</h2>
The Northgate Shopping Center was built in 1979<ref>https:<i>www.loopnet.com/Listing/2224-Cypress-Creek-Pkwy-Houston-TX/13523035/</ref> at the corner of FM 1960 and Kuykendahl Road as an addition to a department store next to it.<ref>http:</i>safewayalbertsonstexas.blogspot.com/2016/01/the-mysterious-randalls-at-kuykendahl.html</ref> Showbiz Pizza Place would presumably begin construction sometime after the beginning of 1981

This location originally opened as a Showbiz Pizza Place on June 25th, 1981. Like every Showbiz Pizza location, this location featured the Rock-afire Explosion. Like most other Showbiz Pizza stores in the late 1980s, this location would receive the Showbiz Pizza Campground upgrade.

<h2>=Chuck E. Cheese's</h2>=
Presumably around 1991/1992, the store would undergo <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Concept Unification" >}}">Concept Unification</a>. Not that much information is known about this store, but had received several changes/remodels on its stage and store over the years.

Around 2009-2010, this location received the 2005 Update of the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative, involving some slight downsizing at the back of the store and replacing the 3-Stage for a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Studio C Beta" >}}">Studio C Beta</a> with a 16M movement bot.

Over the years, the store's surrounding area would worsen as its shopping center became more abandoned, causing crime rates at this location to be on the rise. Because of these issues, this location would plan a relocation to the North Junction Plaza, eventually being announced with the closure originally planned around March 2018, but was delayed. This location would close their doors on August 26th, 2018 and reopen their new location on September 1st the same year at Houston, TX (146 FM 1960)|146 FM 1960. To this day, this store still remains abandoned and vacant.
