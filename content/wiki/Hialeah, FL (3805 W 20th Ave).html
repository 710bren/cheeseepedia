Sometime around late 2016, Neon lights were added to buildings of the Road Stage. The removal of Jasper's hat occurred between January-March 2019.</p>
<p><h3> 2020s </h3></p>
<p>Around 2020 and 2021, The Road Stage fell into a state of disrepair after reopening from the pandemic, As Helen couldn’t move nor move her eyes, Munch couldn’t touch his keyboard, And Jasper was completely aired down for a year and the spotlights (Including the wink Spotlight) were broken.</p>
<p>The stage was removed on November 28th, 2021, for the 2.0 Remodel and Dance Floor with the video wall. All of the animatronics  were being destroyed.  It’s also noteworthy that Hialeah was the first Road Stage removed for 2.0.</p>
