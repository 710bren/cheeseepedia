**_1610 Sam Rittenberg Blvd Ste. 103, Store #966**_ was a Showbiz Pizza Place that opened on September 20th, 1982. 

##History##
Charleston opened on September 20th, 1982 as the first Showbiz in South Carolina (And in the Carolinas overall). The store was originally a Franchise store owned by the McBiz Corporation (along with 29 other locations). They would later end up receiving the 1988 Remodel removing the old Showbiz decor, and adding newer decor.  This would be the last thing to happen to the Charleston ShowBiz. In 1991 Charleston  received Concept Unification which removed the Rock-Afire for the 3-Stage and removed all Showbiz decor, & added new decor. The restaurant kept the ShowBiz pizza name on the building until Late 1991. On September 16, 1996 Charleston was bought by Corporate along with Columbia, & Greenville. Between 1993-1994 Charleston received [Phase 1]({{< ref "wiki/Phase 1 (1994).md" >}}). The store's 3-Stage is on the right side wall. Charleston also had a rare private party room with Record Posters and other 90s decor. In between 2000 and 2002 Charleston received the [Phase 3]({{< ref "wiki/Phase 3 (2000).md" >}}) remodel with replaced all 1 and 2 phase art for phase 3 art. Also in Mid 2000, Charleston stared using plastic masks on all the characters. In 2008 they removed Chuck's Tuxedo and replaced it with the Avenger Outfit. Although the curtains where disabled in 2005 Charleston keep them. During COVID-19 in 2020, Charleston was sadly one of 34 locations to close; in June 2020 (Charleston was closed in June 18th), After 34 years in Charleston, the store would be permanently closed.

### Crimes ###
In November 2018 a man was shot in the store's parking lot.

## Stages ##
Originally when the store opened, they had a Rock-Afire Explosion, as all other Showbiz locations did.  They would have it for a few years, until around 1991, when they would undergo Concept Unification, this was the process used to turn the RAE into the CEC characters. They would have the show until the store's closure on June 18th, 2020.
