This location opened in December 1996 with a 2 Stage that came from the Merced CA location. The bots are the original PTT bots with unretrofitted PTT arm movements. Some cool things about this stage are Chuck still has his hat, Helenâ€™s 90s mask, The base Chuck is standing on, and how the stage is a prototype 2 Stage. This store also has the Star Stage character posters in the showroom
