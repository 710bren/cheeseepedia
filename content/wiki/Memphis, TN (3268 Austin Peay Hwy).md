##History##
Memphis (Austin Peay) opened its doors on August 7th, 1983  as the 7th Showbiz Pizza Place in Tennessee.  originally featured the Rock-Afire Explosion, as all other Showbiz locations did. they would have it for a few years, until around 1991, when they would receive the 1988 remodel, receiving Concept Unification, where the Rock-Afire Explosion characters were changed to the Chuck E. Cheese characters, and removing all SPP decor for newer decor. It was originally a franchised-owned store. Like many other ShowBiz Pizza locations, it had a typical SPP layout seen in many other stores across the United States and would eventually receive the 1988 remodel years after it would open. Fortunately, some documentation exists back in the ShowBiz days. Like many ShowBiz locations in the late 1980s, Memphis (Austin Peay) received the Showbiz Pizza Campground upgrade. On September 16, 1996, the store was acquired by Corporate alongside 18 other locations including the other location on [Hickory Hill]({{< ref "wiki/Memphis, TN (3649 Hickory Hill Rd).md" >}}).

In around the Mid-Late 1990's, Memphis (Austin Peay) received another remodel which removed some early 90's decor and added new decor and SkyTubes. Memphis (Austin Peay) remained this way until April 2013, when they closed permanently. After their closure they would remain abandoned for a couple years until in 2017 when a CitiTrends moved in. Currently, as of February 2023, they still exist.
