##History##
San Antonio (Military) opened in September 1981 and had a Balcony Stage. It was originally a franchised location. It survived the 1984 bankruptcy and was bought on October 22, 1984 along with many other locations by corporate. Around the Late 80's, they would receive the 1988 remodel, removing old PTT decor, renaming the store to Showbiz Pizza, and received the C-Stage. They also removed the Waving Flags. They would later change back to Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza in 1991-1992. They would receive either [https://chuckepedia.com/wiki/Phase_1_(1994) Phase 1] or [https://chuckepedia.com/wiki/Phase_2_(1997) Phase 2] in the mid to late 1990's which added a lot of 1990s decor and assets such as the Record Posters and Colored Chase Lights, removed older decor and removed the C-Stage for the 2-Stage. They would remain like this until 2010 when they received the 2005 remodel (Phase 4) removing the Showroom walls, Balcony Seating, relocating and rebuilding the road sign to be in front of the store, and relocating the stage. The sign changed to the Phase 5 sign around 2016 because of wear and tear on the old sign. They would remain like this until they received the one of the first of the 7 2.0 remodels in July 2017 removing the 2-Stage for the Dance Floor. Strangely, they kept the Phase 4 booths.  As of January 2023, they still have the 2.0 remodel and the Dance Floor.
