**_275 Route 4 West, Store #482**_ is a _Chuck E. Cheese_ in Paramus, New Jersey. As of August 2024, the location still exists with the 2.0 remodel.

This is the relocation of the [Paramus (221 South Dr)]({{< ref "wiki/Paramus, NJ (221 South Dr).md" >}}) location which opened on October 18, 1993 and closed in November 2010 with their [1-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/1-Stage.md" >}}).

## History ##
Paramus (275 Route 4 West) opened as a relocation to the [221 South Dr]({{< ref "wiki/Paramus, NJ (221 South Dr).md" >}}) on December 26th, 2011 with a Studio C Beta, 16M; this was the last Studio C store to open in the state in New Jersey. When the store opened, they had the 2010 Update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative. In around the Mid 2010's, this was one of the small handful of locations to test the 'Chuck E Cheese Fun House' from Soft Play; this was removed during the COVID-19 Pandemic (Like with the [Skytubes]({{< ref "wiki/Skytubes.md" >}})). This was also one of the stores to test the 'Chuck E.'s Express Ordering' Kiosks, this have also since been removed at an unknown point in time. In around 2019, the exterior was repainted alongside the rest of the plaza. As of July 2023, the location has begun the 2.0 remodel

## Stages ##
When Paramus (275 Route 4 West) opened, they housed a Studio C Beta, 16m (One of three in New Jersey) and was the last Studio C store to open in the state of New Jersey. When the store opened, Chuck has his Avenger outfit. In the Mid-Late 2010's, it would be replaced with the Rockstar outfit. As of July 2023, the Beta has been removed and replaced with a Dance Floor and Video Wall.
