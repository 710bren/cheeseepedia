Gigglebee's was a chain started by Piccadilly Circus that broke off and became it's own entity. The pizza place offered arcade games, laser tag, bumper cars, and skeeball.<ref>https://hot1047.com/whatever-happened-to-gigglebees-in-sioux-falls/</ref> The main attraction of the restaurant however was the pizza serving animatronics on tracks that could  hold conversations with guests. <ref>https://www.e-flux.com/architecture/workplace/430311/performing-automation/</ref>

## History ##

### Founding ###
In 1985 the company Piccadilly Circus set up a pizza restaurant in Sioux Falls, South Dakota called Pizza Peddler.

### Splitting Off ###
In 1989 after losing a contest of some sort Pizza Peddler split off from Piccadilly Circus and became it's own independent restaurant labelled Gigglebee's.

### Closing ###
After heavy competition from other pizza places such as Chuck E Cheese the company was forced to sell their land roughly around July 18, 2008. <ref>https://www.argusleader.com/story/news/2019/07/18/sioux-falls-solved-wheres-wilbur-the-coyote-gigglebees/1573523001/</ref> An auction was held on October 25th of that same year.<ref name=':0'>https://coreyvilhauer.com/2008/10/28/goodbye-to-gigglebees/</ref> The plot was then converted into an office space and a bank. 

## Characters ##
