<b><i>5911 University Ave Ste. 100</b></i> is a <i>Chuck E. Cheese's</i> that opened on August 1, 2001, with a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Studio C Beta" >}}">Studio C Beta</a> and is still open today with the 2.0 remodel.

<h2> History </h2>
Cedar Falls opened on August 1, 2001, with a Phase 3 remodel and <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Studio C Beta" >}}">Studio C Beta</a>. Unfortunately, there isn't much info on Cedar Falls from this time. In 2006-2008, Cedar Falls received the 2005 update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative, which involved the removal of 90s decor, dim lighting, changed the exterior, and added purple walls. The Skytubes were removed some time afterwards. In late-August 2022, the location began 2.0, removing the Beta for a 2021 Model <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Chuck E Live Stage (Dance Floor)" >}}">Dance Floor</a> and <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Video Wall" >}}">Video Wall</a>. As of August 2023, Cedar Falls remains like this.
