<p><b><i>15511 Edwards St, Store #406</b></i> is the fifth <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Pizza Time Theatre" >}}">Chuck E. Cheese's <i>Pizza Time Theatre</i></a> location, opening on October 6, 1979, and is currently the oldest operating CEC in the world.</p>
<p>The former oldest was <a href="{{< ref "wiki/San Jose, CA (1371 Kooser Rd)" >}}">San Jose, CA (1371 Kooser Rd)</a>, which closed in June 2020 as one of the 61 locations closed in 2020. It is also the last location to have been from the 70's after Kooser's closure.</p>
<p><h2>History</h2></p>
<p>Huntington Beach opened on October 6th, 1979. Unfortunately, information on the Huntington location during its time as a PTT is scarce with not even any newspapers from the 70's being found of the location, but it is known that they had a Portrait Stage and a Cabaret Helen Henny.</p>
<p>Huntington remained unchanged until 1989/1990 when it received the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/SPT 1988 Remodel Program" >}}">SPT 1988 Remodel Program</a>, where the Portrait Stage was replaced with Chuck E.'s House Facade, early 90's decor was added, and the Cabaret Helen Henny was removed.</p>
<p>It would remain like this until a second remodel in the mid-late 90's That Being The <a href="{{< ref "wiki/SPT 1992 Remodel Program" >}}">1996 Update to Operation: Thumb Chuck</a>. The C-Stage would be removed in favor of a 2-Stage, as was the early 90's decor in favor of new decor and SkyTubes. A drop celling was added to the location in this remodel, as it had originally been built with open ceilings.</p>
<p>The location would retain these changes until they remodeled to the 2005 Update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative between 2006-2007. During this remodel, they removed the Showroom Walls, Portrait Seating, and relocated the 2-Stage. The 2-Stage and 2005 Update still remain as of April 2023.</p>
<p>In November 2023, Huntington Beach would remove the curtains on their 2-Stage. The curtains would be sent to the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Northridge, CA (8425 Reseda Blvd)" >}}">Northridge, CA</a> for their 2-Stage, and would be used starting at the reopening as a Throwback Store. Unfortunately, Huntington Beach is set to relocate in mid-to-late 2024 due to the owners of the current building not deciding to renew the lease for it.<sup>[1]</sup> After this, this would mean no more Chuck E. Cheese locations from the 1970s would be in current operation.</p>
<p>During May-June 2024 the stage would decrease even more in operation, Chuck. E’s left eyelid(from viewer’s perspective) would be removed, his Head moving up wouldn’t work, and most of the air flow in him would not enter certain places, like his torso. Helen’s Eyelids would be removed for repairs, and her mouth stopped functioning. Munch is the only perfect one in operation. Jasper cannot move his head up, and his eye is wonky, Pasqually lost the back of his head and mouth moving.</p>
<p>Huntington Beach would receive the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/CEC 2018 20 Remodel Program" >}}">Trampoline Zone</a> alongside <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Chino, CA (5250 Philadelphia St)" >}}">Chino, CA</a> around this time. In August 2024, most of the problems mentioned would be fixed. The animatronics will be staying until this locations relocation later this year.</p>
<p><h2>Stages</h2></p>
<p>Huntington Beach opened with the Portrait Stage in October 1979. Unfortunately, there are some photos but hardly any videos to exist of Huntington Beach during its PTT/CECP Era.</p>
