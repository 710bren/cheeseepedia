The <b>Cyberamic 3-Stage</b> was a stage format found at the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Lynnwood, WA (3717 196th St Suite 100)" >}}">Lynnwood, Washington</a> Chuck E. Cheese's location. Lynnwood had a normal 3-Stage, but replaced the CEI bots with Cyberamics from the Spokane, Washington store in 2000, since Spokane relocated. Springfield, Massachusetts also installed this stage in late 2017, but Springfield permanently closed during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.
<h2> History </h2>
<h3> Lynwood (2000-2023) </h3>
Sometime in 2000, this store replaced their CEI bots with the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Spokane, WA (2301 W Wellesley Ave)" >}}">Spokane, WA (2301 W Wellesley Ave)</a> Cyberamics. The reason for this is unknown but it was likely that the CEI bots were in poor condition. The props from Spokane were also put on the stage while still retaining Chuck E.'s tuxedo and Jasper's PTT mask as well as Munch's hat. Uniquely, the bottom part of Helen's skirt is missing giving her a distinct appearance. Lynnwood closed permanently on July 23, 2023.
<h3> Springfield (2017-2020) </h3>
Around Fall 2017, after the Burlington, MA store had closed in July, Springfield replaced their existing CEI bots with Cyberamics from Burlington's 2 Stage. The Replacement of the Old bots was likely due to the fact that the CEI bots were in disrepair and weren't being maintained well. The CEI bots were suited for replacement previously in 2006 with a Studio C 2000|Studio C Beta due to a fire, however, the update was never finalized. Coming from the Burlington store, the 2-stage city background was moved to Chuck E's stage and Jasper's banjo kept with him. Munch's hat did not make it to the new location unfortunately. In 2020 when the store closed, the stage was immediately destroyed leaving Lynnwood as the last store to have the Cyberamic 3-Stage.
<h2> Designs </h2>
<h3> Lynnwood (2000-2023) </h3>
<h4> Stage Left (Chuck E. Cheese) </h4>
Stage Right features Chuck E Cheese (Cyberamic)|Chuck E. Cheese with the star from Spokane's 2-Stage behind him and a TV next to him, there is also the neon sign reading 'Chuck E.

<h4> Center Stage (Helen Henny, Mr. Munch, Jasper T. Jowls) </h4>
Center Stage features <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Guest Star  Helen Henny (Cyberamic)" >}}">Helen Henny</a>, <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Mr Munch (Cyberamic)" >}}">Mr. Munch</a>, and <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Jasper T Jowls (Cyberamic)" >}}">Jasper T. Jowls</a>. Building, Moon, and Munch Jr. were removed during the switchover to Cyberamics in 2000. On top of the stage on the valence in the middle above Munch is the Wink, which is a small Chuck E. head that winks at the end of songs / segments. Lynwood has the Cyberamic Wink, which came from Spokane's 2-Stage. The design of Center Stage is like a rooftop or city skyline, with there being buildings (Lynwood has both 3-Stage and 2-Stage buildings, with the 2-Stage buildings coming from Spokane's 2-Stage) in the background and flowers too. There is also a big sign that reads 'Munch's Make Believe Band' on it.
<h4> Stage Right (Pasqually) </h4>
Stage Left features Pasqually. Pizzacam was removed during the switchover to Cyberamics in 2000. Pasqually is not positioned on a platform like the normal 3-Stage. The design of Stage Right is a brick wall that reads 'Pasqually's Amateur Hour'. Pasqually uses the drumset that came from Spokane's 2-Stage, in which the bass drum resonant head (front head) reads 'Tempo' on it.

Jowls</a>. Building and Moon were removed during the switchover to Cyberamics in 2017 (As well as Munch Jr., who was removed years before converting to Cyberamics). Center Stage remained relatively unchanged as the store's Munch's Make Believe Band Sign was removed from when they still had the original animatronics. On top of the stage on the valence in the middle above Munch was the Wink which was the same exact same one as they had since Concept Unification and was not replaced during the conversion. The design of Center Stage was like a rooftop or city skyline, with there being buildings in the background and flowers too which were the same ones that they had since they were converted into a Chuck E. Cheese back in 1991. The flood lights were replaced with the ones from Burlington.
<h4> Stage Right (Pasqually) </h4>
Stage Left featured Pasqually. Pizzacam was removed years before converting to Cyberamics. Pasqually is not positioned on a platform like the normal 3-Stage.
