**_1001 Commons Dr, Dothan, AL 36303**_ was a _Chuck E. Cheese's_ that opened on August 19th, 2004 with a unique [[Studio C Cappa]] stage.

This store is not to be confused with the [[Dothan, AL (3400 Ross Clark Circle)]] location, which closed in April of 1998.

## Stages## 
[\2](\1)
The store opened with a [[Studio C Cappa]] stage. This stage appears to be completely unique to the store, being without a large TV and instead a light-blue wall with 3 smaller TVs with green and blue LED light strips behind them and a small CEC sign below also with the light strip, as well as a small lime-green wall to the right of Chuck E's stage. These wall colors somewhat resemble the larger Phase 5 remodels. It is somewhat apparent that these unique features were added some time after the stage was first installed due to the newer TVs used. The Chuck E. animatronic no longer moves most likely due to the end to Studio C programming in 2022, but is in decent cosmetical condition.

## History## 
The store opened on August 19th, 2004 presumably right around the [[2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative]] was beginning to be rolled out. Because of this, this store got a few features of that remodel such as the red neon lights lining the top of the building and the lack of showroom walls. Despite the timing, the exterior signage still used the 90s 'thumbs up' logo and the red/yellow gradient text. In addition to this, the store art mostly consists of Phase 3 pieces, such as the Must C TV pieces, the sporting equipment, the stars and the sports magazines and the 1999 postcards. Later on, the store received some of the Phase 4 pieces such as the 'King of Cool' pieces and the watercolor piece. The store has mostly remained the same since opening day, and according to the employees, is set to receive the 2.0 remodel at some point in 2024.
