<p>Escondido opened with a Studio C Beta with a 16m bot. Around 2013, Chuck E.'s cap was removed in order to look like Rockstar, which was introduced in 2012. The stage took its final bow in December 2021, as it was removed for a 2021 Model Dance Floor and Video Wall.</p>

<p><h2> History </h2></p>
<p>Escondido opened on January 3, 2007 as the very first CEC to open in 2007. It had the 2005 update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative, which included late 2000s decor, Skytubes, and the Studio C Beta stage. Not much changed throughout the years, other than a few things. These include receiving new game packages, and removing the Skytubes. In December 2021, they received the 2.0 remodel, removing the Studio C Beta for a 2021 Model Dance Floor and Video Wall. As of July 2023, Escondido remains like this.</p>
