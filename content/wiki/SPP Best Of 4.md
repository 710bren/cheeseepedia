**_SPP Best Of 4 / Wave Bday**_ is one of the last few showtapes released for _Showbiz Pizza Place's_ hosting the _Rock-afire Explosion_.

For some stores, this was the last tape used before _Concept Unification_ would start at their location. Each tape sent after [SPP Christmas '89 / Wave Bday]({{< ref "wiki/SPP Christmas '89  Wave Bday.md" >}}) would become increasingly more rare as stores would convert to _3-Stages._

Despite the later years of _Cyberstar_ being mostly re-used segments from earlier showtapes, the last showtapes became the 'Best of' series, bringing back every single _Cyberstar_ segment for stores to have. It was said at this time that due to the _Rock-afire Explosion_ being phased out, stores could play whatever showtapes they had without sticking to the most recent show. The _Best of_ series could be seen as an encouragement of this.
