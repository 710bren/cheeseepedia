All the Studio C segments would be filmed by Brian Hagan with the Chuck E. animatronic in front of a blue screen. This was done in case blue screen footage was ever needed, but ultimately went unused.<ref></ref> These were filmed on DVCAM tapes. 

On December 23, 2021, all the unused footage would be uploaded to Brian's YouTube channel.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTmxzgjgpmE</ref>
