## History ##
Gaithersburg opened in March 1983 (day unknown) with a Balcony Stage. However, information on Gaithersburg as a PTT is scarce. In 1989/1990, they received the 1988 remodel, getting rid of all PTT elements and replacing them with 1988 remodel elements like checkers, and likely replaced the Balcony Stage with Chuck E.'s House Facade, but this is not confirmed. They later got a Road Stage around 1991/1992 without remodeling. Around 1994 or 1995, they received , renovating the entire store, and removing the Road Stage for a 2-Stage. They later received  around 1997/1998. They later received  around 2003/2004, removing the 2-Stage for a Studio C Beta, 16m. In 2005/2006, they received the 2005 update to the [2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative]({{< ref "wiki/2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration  Major Remodel Initiative.md" >}}), replacing the decor, tearing down the showroom walls and balcony seating, changing the exterior again, and added purple walls. Gaithersburg remained like this until June 2020 (day unknown), when they would close permanently. They would remain vacant for a year or two until it became a Five Below. As of July 2023, Five Below is still on the space.
