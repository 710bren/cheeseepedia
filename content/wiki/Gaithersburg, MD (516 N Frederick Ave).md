**_516 N Frederick Ave**_ was a _Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre_ that opened in March 1983 (day unknown) with a [Balcony Stage]({{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage.md" >}}) and closed in June 2020 (day unknown) with a Studio C 2000 (Studio C Beta, 16m).

## Stages ##
Gaithersburg had a Balcony Stage at first. However, not much documentation exists on the stage. It is currently unknown if they had [Chuck E.'s House Facade]({{< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House Facade.md" >}}), but it is likely they did. They later got a [Road Stage]({{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Road Stage.md" >}}) in 1991/1992. It didn't last long as well, because they received a [2-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/2-Stage.md" >}}) in the Mid '90s. They later received a Studio C 2000 (Studio C Beta, 16m) in the Mid 2000s. It lasted up until the 2020 closure.

## History ##
Gaithersburg opened in March 1983 (day unknown) with a Balcony Stage. However, information on Gaithersburg as a PTT is scarce. In 1989/1990, they received the 1988 remodel, getting rid of all PTT elements and replacing them with 1988 remodel elements like checkers, and likely replaced the Balcony Stage with Chuck E.'s House Facade, but this is not confirmed. They later got a Road Stage around 1991/1992 without remodeling. Around 1994 or 1995, they received [Phase 1]({{< ref "wiki/Phase 1 (1994).md" >}}), renovating the entire store, and removing the Road Stage for a 2-Stage. They later received [Phase 2]({{< ref "wiki/Phase 2 (1997).md" >}}) around 1997/1998. They later received [Phase 3]({{< ref "wiki/Phase 3 (2000).md" >}}) around 2003/2004, removing the 2-Stage for a Studio C Beta, 16m. In 2005/2006, they received the 2005 update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative, replacing the decor, tearing down the showroom walls and balcony seating, changing the exterior again, and added purple walls. Gaithersburg remained like this until June 2020 (day unknown), when they would close permanently. They would remain vacant for a year or two until it became a Five Below. As of July 2023, Five Below is still on the space.
