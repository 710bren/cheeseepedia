<b><i>1001 W Hampden Ave, Store #721</b></i> was a Showbiz Pizza Place that opened on July 16, 1981 as a corporate <i>ShowBiz Pizza Place</i> with a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Classic Stage" >}}">Rock-Afire Explosion</a>.
<h2>History </h2>
Englewood opened its doors on July 16th, 1981 with a Rock-afire Explosion show. It was originally and currently a corporate-owned store. Like many other ShowBiz Pizza locations, it had a typical SPP layout seen in many other stores across the United States and would eventually receive the 1988 remodel years after it would open. Although very little documentation exists back in the ShowBiz days, it can be determined that Englewood was one of several locations to receive an Uncle Klunk show package (and a Santa Claus retrofit package as well) sometime after opening. Like many ShowBiz locations in the late 1980s, Englewood received the Showbiz Pizza Campground upgrade.
In around 1991/1992, Englewood received Concept Unification which converted the show to Munch's Make Believe Band. In around the Mid-Late 1990's, Englewood received either <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Phase 1 (1994)" >}}">Phase 1</a> or <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Phase 2 (1997)" >}}">Phase 2</a> remodel which removed some early 90's decor and added new decor, SkyTubes, & an exterior expansion. Sometime in around Early-Mid 2000, Englewood received the Phase 3 remodel which removed the 3-Stage for the Studio C Alpha. Englewood remained this way until sometime in 2009 when they received the 2005 Remodel which involved removing the Showroom Walls, balcony Seating, expanding the back of the store, and also removing some older 90's decor. In October 2022, they received the 2.0 remodel removing the Alpha for the Dance Floor. They were formerly the last non 2.0 store in Colorado but as of January 2023, they still have the 2.0 remodel and dance floor and Colorado is officially considered 'bot-less'.
<h2> Stages</h2>
Englewood opened with the Rock afire Explosion in July 1981. Unfortunately, there are some photos but no videos to exist of Englewood with the Rock afire, or as a ShowBiz in general.
In 1991/1992, Englewood received <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Concept Unification" >}}">Concept Unification</a>, converting the Rock afire into Munchâ€™s Make Believe Band.
Sometime in around Early-Mid 2000, Englewood removed the 3-Stage for the Studio C Alpha stage.
