**Mentor, OH (8000 Plaza Blvd).** is a Chuck E. Cheese's located across the street from Great Lakes Mall in Mentor OH. It opened as a Pizza Time Theatre, then became one of the 7 Pizza Time Theatres rebranded to Marc's Funtime Pizza Palace. 

## History ##

### Pizza Time Theatre ###
Mentor opened as a Pizza Time Theatre in the 1980's, and had a balcony stage. It also featured The King, and Doli Dimples. At some point the balcony was converted to a C Stage. 

### Marc's Funtime Pizza Palace ###
In the late 80's Marc Glassman, owner of the Marc's grocery chain, purchased the Mentor Pizza Time Theatre when the franchise owner left the area and the store was converted to Marc's Funtime Pizza Palace. Like the other Marc's locations, Mentor location would keep the exisiting stage, but convert the characters. The location would end up closing in 1996.

### Chuck E. Cheese's ###
Mentor would re-open as a CEC in 1998 up the plaza from its old location. The store would be the last new store to open with a Cyberamic stage, as Studio C Alphas were being installed in stores by this point. The location got the 2005 remodel in 2006, and expanded in 2009.
