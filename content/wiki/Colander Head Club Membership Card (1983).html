The <b><i>Colander Head Club Membership Card</b></i> was a special card produced for contributing patrons of the [[Crazy Colander Head Night (Event)|Crazy Colander Head Night Event]] during the month of March 1983.

The card could be used to win prizes on Wednesday nights during the event if also wearing a colander to the restaurant.

<h2> Obtainability </h2>
The card was obtainable by fulfilling multiple criteria from March 1st - 31st of 1983.<ref>[[The Colander Gazette - Vol 1. No. 1 (February 24, 1983)|The Colander Gazette - Vol 1. No. 1]]</ref>

# Attend a ShowBiz Pizza Place wearing a colander on your head, encouraged to be customized and decorated but not required.
# Request the staff to play the [[3 Birthday Shows - Colander History - Indoctrination Skit|Indoctrination Skit]] in the Showroom, or wait till Wednesday nights where the show would be played for the groups attending.
# Watch the skit and follow along with its instructions by taking the oath (though following along was not enforced).

A ShowBiz employee would then hand you the card. Patrons could then return each Wednesday night to receive 6 free tokens, a free coke, and a signed picture of one of the Rock-afire Explosion characters. Despite Colander Night returning in September of 1983 for the [[ShowBiz's Fabulous Fall Festival (Event)|ShowBiz's Fabulous Fall Festival]], the membership card would not be handed out- nor used to identify members for prizes.<ref>[Crazy Colander Head Night (Event)]({{< ref "wiki/Crazy Colander Head Night (Event).html" >}})</ref>
