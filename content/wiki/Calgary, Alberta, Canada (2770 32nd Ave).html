<p><h2> Trivia </h2></p><ul><li>Calgary 32nd Ave was the only CEC to ever get a used Road Stage from a closed location as it was Franchised at the time, they received it and most Road Stages that were being removed were either removed altogether or converted into a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/1-Stage" >}}">1-Stage</a> or a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/2-Stage" >}}">2-Stage</a>. This is also the only case of this ever happening.</li></ul>
