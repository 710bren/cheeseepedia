The <b><i>Opening Team Pin (Avenger)</b></i> was given to CEC employees for being the first employees during a store's opening, to be worn on their lanyard.
<h2>Design</h2>
The design is a metal pin featuring Coach Chuck art. The bottom section of the pin says 'Opening Team', alongside a section for the name of the store. The store name seems to be white plastic embedded into the metal with the name pressed and printed into it.

<h2>= Store Variations </h2>=

* 'New Hartford, NY' ([New Hartford, NY (4631 Commercial Dr)]({{< ref "wiki/New Hartford, NY (4631 Commercial Dr).html" >}}), 2006)

<h2>Acquirement</h2>
Employees could receive this pin if they filled any position within the first week of a store's opening.
