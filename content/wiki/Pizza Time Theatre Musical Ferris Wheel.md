The **_Pizza Time Theatre Musical Ferris Wheel**_ was a _Pizza Time Theatre_ themed variant of the _Musical Ferris Wheel_ by _Amusement Technology_.

After inserting a quarter, the ride would spin the child in the seat around while playing fair ground music.

## Variants ##
Two variants exist for the ride. One features the standard winking Chuck E. Cheese head, while the more common one features the standard art of Chuck holding a cane up.
