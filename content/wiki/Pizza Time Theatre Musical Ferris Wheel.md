The <b><i>Pizza Time Theatre Musical Ferris Wheel</b></i> was a [Pizza Time Theatre]({{< ref "wiki/Pizza Time Theatre.md" >}}) themed variant of the <i>Musical Ferris Wheel</i> by All-Tech Industries.<ref>https://www.arcade-history.com/?n=musical-ferris-wheel&page=detail&id=33458</ref>

After inserting a quarter, the ride would spin the child in the seat around while playing 1-bit fair ground music.<ref>https://youtu.be/P56zAQ0LOKM</ref>

<h2> Variants </h2>
Two variants exist for the ride. One features the standard winking Chuck E. Cheese head, while the more common one features the standard art of Chuck holding a cane up.
