**_Tampa, FL (4202 E Fowler Ave)**_ is a cancelled ShowBiz Pizza Place that would have been placed in the University of South Florida, per possible request by Aaron Fechter.

Aaron notes the plans as '...it didn't go over that hot. They didn't really see it as anything.'. He theorizes that a junior-high oriented pizza parlor wouldn't have meshed well with the college town.<ref>https://www.showbizpizza.com/info/articles/spp/spp_83dayton2.pdf</ref>

## Trivia ##

* Prior to this location's cancellation, this would have been the only ShowBiz Pizza location to be located on a college or school campus. To this day, Chuck E. Cheese does not have any college or school campus locations.
