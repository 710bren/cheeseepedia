Tampa, FL (???) is a cancelled ShowBiz Pizza Place that would have been placed near the University of South Florida, per possible request by Aaron Fechter.

Aaron notes the plans as '...it didn't go over that hot. They didn't really see it as anything.'. He theorizes that a junior-high oriented pizza parlor wouldn't have meshed well with the college town.<ref>https://www.showbizpizza.com/info/articles/spp/spp_83dayton2.pdf</ref>
