**_SPP Christmas '90 / Wave Bday**_ is one of the last few showtapes released for _Showbiz Pizza Place's_ hosting the _Rock-afire Explosion_.

For some stores, this was the last tape used before _Concept Unification_ would start at their location. Each tape sent after [[SPP Christmas '89 / Wave Bday]] would become increasingly more rare as stores would convert to _3-Stages._

This show has the same segments, and music videos from last years release, but the copyrighted music that played during the countdowns is the newest addition.
