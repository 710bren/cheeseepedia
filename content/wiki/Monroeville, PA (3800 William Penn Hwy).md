##History##
Monroeville opened in March 1993 as the relocation of the original Monroeville location as it was just across the street and was also originally a franchise owned location. It is no longer located in the Holiday Center Shopping Mall but rather, right across from it. Unfortunately, there isn't much documentation of Monroeville back then. Monroeville opened with the 1992 update of the 1988 remodel which had the checkers around the store, Blue and White awnings above the salad bar, Record Posters and other decor, and the 2-Stage. In the Late 90's, Monroeville received the Phase 2 remodel removing older decor including the Record Posters, adding newer decor, received another exterior change this time renaming the sign and exterior to 'Chuck E. Cheese's', and adding SkyTubes which replaced the ball pit.
