<b><i>3800 William Penn Hwy, Store #537</b></i> was a Chuck E. Cheese that opened in March 1993 (day not found) with a 2-Stage, and closed on March 30, 2024.<ref>https://www.wtae.com/article/chuck-e-cheese-monroeville-closing/60217485</ref>

It should not be confused with the [original Monroeville location]({{< ref "wiki/Monroeville, PA (3813 William Penn Hwy).md" >}}) which was just across the street and opened in the Holiday Center Shopping Mall opened 11 years prior in March 1982 with a Balcony Stage and relocated to this store in March 1993 with Chuck E.'s House Facade and was also the first CEC to open in Pennsylvania.
<h2>History</h2>
Monroeville opened in March 1993 as the relocation of the original Monroeville location as it was just across the street and was also originally a franchise owned location. It is no longer located in the Holiday Center Shopping Mall but rather, right across from it. Unfortunately, there isn't much documentation of Monroeville back then. Monroeville opened with the 1992 update of the 1988 remodel which had the checkers around the store, Blue and White awnings above the salad bar, Record Posters and other decor, and the 2-Stage. In the Late 90's, Monroeville received the Phase 2 remodel removing older decor including the Record Posters, adding newer decor, received another exterior change this time renaming the sign and exterior to 'Chuck E. Cheese's', and adding SkyTubes which replaced the ball pit. Around 2005-2006, Monroeville received the 2005 update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative which involved the removal the Showroom Walls, Balcony Seating, relocating the stage, and remodeling the exterior (Which was an expansion), removing older decor for newer decor, and got a road sign change. Monroeville would remain like this until August 2018 when they received the 2.0 Remodel removing the 2-Stage for the Dance Floor and Video Wall. It was the first 2.0 in Pennsylvania. On March 15th, 2024, it was announced that the store would close down on March 30th allegedly due to staffing issues. The store would later close down on March 30th, 2024.
<h2>Stages</h2>
Originally, when the store opened in March 1993, they had a 2-Stage like every other CEC location at the time. Fortunately, a couple videos do exist of Monroeville.

In August 2018, Monroeville received the 2.0 remodel and removed the 2-Stage for the Dance Floor and Video Wall.
