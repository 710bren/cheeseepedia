<h2>Design</h2>
This plush uses a magenta fur base with orange fur detailing on his feet, chest and eyebrows. His hair uses a fuzzy yellow material that is easy to be manipulated. He has a rectangular body and legs that can be put in a sitting and standing position.  He has two stubby arms with thumbs. His head is round and has a set of felt teeth. 

This plush's eyes have a complicated construction. His iris and pupils are made from the same plastic ball. The blue iris is hollowed out for the black pupil. These eyes give the illusion that his eyes are looking at you. Surrounding those plastic eyes is a piece of white felt to replicate the white in his eyes. A pink piece of felt is used for the eye lids. The plush is stuffed with synthetic fibers and shredded foam. 

The plush's tag reads <b>Mr. Munch Pizza Time Theatre, Inc</b> The back of the tag reads as <i>'Handcrafted By California Stuffed Toys Los Angeles, CA Contents: Synthetic Fibers and/or Shredded foam PA. 173 Made in Taiwan'.</i>
