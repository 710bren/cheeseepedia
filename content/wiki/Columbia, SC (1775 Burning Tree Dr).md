**_1775 Burning Tree Dr**_ is a _Showbiz Pizza/Chuck E. Cheese_ that opened on June 28, 1983 as a Franchised _ShowBiz Pizza Place_ with a [https://chuckepedia.com/wiki/Classic_Stage Rock-Afire Explosion].
##History##
Columbia opened its doors on June 28th, 1983 with a Rock-afire Explosion show. It was originally a franchised-owned store. Like many other ShowBiz Pizza locations, it had a typical SPP layout seen in many other stores across the United States and would eventually receive the 1988 remodel years after it would open removing older SPP decor for newer SPP decor. Unfortunately, very little documentation exists back in the ShowBiz Pizza era.

In around 1991/1992, Columbia received Concept Unification which converted the show to Munch's Make Believe Band and received Phase 2 with a new exterior. Around the Mid-Late 1990's, Columbia received the Phase 3 remodel which removed some early 90's decor and added new decor, SkyTubes and also an exterior change. On September 16th, 1996, the location was sold to corporate along with Charleston, Greenville, and a few others. Columbia remained this way until sometime in 2006-2007 when they received the 2005 Remodel (Phase 4) which involved removing the Showroom Walls, balcony Seating, received another exterior change, relocating the stage, and also removing some older 90's decor. They would also expand the store which included space to fit in more games and tables. Columbia would remain like this until October 2022 when they received 2.0 and removed the 3-Stage for the Dance Floor and Video Wall. As of January 2023, they still have the 2.0 Remodel and the Dance Floor.
