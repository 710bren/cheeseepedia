<b><i>8101 Tonelle Ave, Store #485</b></i> was a Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza that opened on December 20, 1993 with a 1-Stage, which is still open to this day.

The location started their 2.0 Remodel in October 2022, removing the 1-Stage, along with Edison (which has already removed the stage), East Hanover (also a 1-Stage), and Wayne (Last Road Stage in New Jersey), for a Dance Floor. The Grand Reopening occurred on December 20th, 2022.

<h2> Stages </h2>
Originally when the store opened, they had the [SPT 1992 Remodel Program]({{< ref "wiki/SPT 1992 Remodel Program.md" >}}) which included checkers around the store and a 1-Stage show. North Bergen would receive the CEC 2005 Remodel in 2008, however their exterior still included checkers. They would have the 1-Stage for 28 years and 9 months, until October 2022, when they would start the 2.0 Remodel.
