**8101 Tonnelle Ave, North Bergen, NJ 07047** was a Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza that opened on December 20, 1993 with a 1-Stage, which is still open to this day.

This location is currently remodeling to 2.0, removing the 1-Stage, along with Edison (which has already removed the stage), East Hanover (also a 1-Stage), and Wayne (Last Road Stage in New Jersey), for a Dance Floor.

## Stages ##
Originally when the store opened, they had 1-Stage. They would have the 1-Stage for 28 years and 9 months, Until October 2022, when they would start the 2.0 Remodel, they are one of the several New Jersey Existing Stages to receive the 2.0 remodel at this time, including Edison, East Hanover, and Wayne (Edison removed their 1-Stage on October 4th, 2022, East Hanover has a 1-Stage, and Wayne has the last Road Stage in the state). With these 4 locations remodeling, there will only be 3 Existing Stages left in the state, Cherry Hill which is the last 2-Stage in the state, and Deptford and Middletown, which are also both 1-Stages.
