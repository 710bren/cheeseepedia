**_4031 95th St**_ was a _Showbiz Pizza Place_ which opened on January 19, 1983 with a Rock-Afire Explosion, and closed on November 26, 2017 with the Studio C Beta, 16m.

## History## 
Oak Lawn opened its doors on January 19th, 1983 with the Rock-Afire Explosion show like every other Showbiz Pizza. It was originally a corporate-owned location. It also was originally opened next to a Kmart which opened on May 18th, 1978 and a PayLess ShoeSource. In either 1989 or 1990, Oak Lawn received the 1988 remodel removing the older SPP decor, adding newer decor, received a new exterior change, and updated the Billy Bob stage. In 1991 or 1992, Oak Lawn received a major remodel, adding checkers around the wall, added Blue and White Awnings, and added more decor and removed some older decor, and received Concept Unification removing the Rock-Afire Explosion for the 3-Stage. Oak Lawn received a minor remodel in the Mid-90's removing older CU decor for the Record Posters.

Around the late 90's, Oak Lawn would receive the so called 'Phase 2' remodel which removed all older 90's decor, added newer decor, and added SkyTubes. The Kmart was then rebuilt during these changes to the CEC.

In 2006-2007, Oak Lawn received the 2005 remodel removing older decor, removing the Showroom Walls, Balcony Seating, expanding the store, relocating the stage, and also removing the 3-Stage for the Studio C Beta.

Oak Lawn remained like this until November 26th, 2017 when they closed because of fighting. The Kmart and Payless ShoeSource also closed down. After closure, the location was abandoned until 2021 when it and Payless ShoeSource were turned into an Amazon Store. The Kmart was turned into a medical group center.

Currently, as of February 2023, the Amazon Fresh building is still there.
