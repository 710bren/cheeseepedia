##  Stages ## 
Originally, the store had a [[Studio C Alpha]], it was the 4th store to open with a Alpha. They would have it for 17 years, until May of 2015, when they would receive a brand new stage, that featured no animatronics, and light up posters from a Circles Of Light stage, this is called the [[Chuck E. Live Stage (Dance Floor)]], and is currently being installed in 2.0 stores. Plano's Studio C Alpha was sent to the Dearborn Michigan store, which they still have the stage. Plano upgraded to the 2019 Model of Dance Floor sometime in 2019, but they kept the ceiling fixture.
