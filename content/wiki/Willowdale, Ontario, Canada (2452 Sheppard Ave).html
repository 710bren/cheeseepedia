<p><h2>History</h2></p>
<p>Willowdale (North York) opened in the Victoria Park Square shopping center on October 8th, 1983, with the Balcony Stage and they also had a large Chuck E. Cheese statue next to the Balcony Stage. They would remain like this until in the Late 80's when they would receive the 1988 Remodel removing old PTT decor and added Concept Unification decor and removed the Balcony Stage for the C-Stage. In the Early 90's, they would receive the Phase 1 Remodel removing some older decor, adding new games, and a change to the exterior. In the Mid 90's. they received the Phase 2 remodel which removed more older decor, added newer decor, and removing the C-Stage for the 2-Stage. In the Late 90's, they removed some decor, added new decor, removed older games and added newer games, changed the exterior logo, and SkyTubes. They would remain like this until 2008-2009 when they received the 2005 remodel removing the Showroom Walls, Balcony Seating, and the relocation of SkyTubes. Strangely, the exterior was not changed and the statue has stayed in the same spot since opening. Currently, as of February 2023, they still have the 2-Stage, the 2005 Remodel, and the Chuck E. Cheese statue.</p>
