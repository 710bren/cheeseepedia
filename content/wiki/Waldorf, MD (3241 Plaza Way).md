**_3241 Plaza Way**_ is a Chuck E. Cheese's that opened on June 18, 2012 and is still open today with the [CEC 2018 2.0 Remodel Program]({{< ref "wiki/CEC 2018 20 Remodel Program.md" >}}), which was the last store to open with one.

This was the relocation of [Waldorf, MD (2928 Festival Way)]({{< ref "wiki/Waldorf, MD (2928 Festival Way).md" >}}) which opened on March 24, 1992 with the first ever [1-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/1-Stage.md" >}}) and closed on May 24, 2012 with a Studio C (1997) (Studio C Alpha), which was brought over to the new store.

## Stages ##
Waldorf opened with a Studio C Alpha, which was from the old store. On September 19, 2022, the bot was no longer going to be programmed. In late 2023, the Studio C Alpha would be taken out in favor of a Chuck E. Live Stage (Dance Floor) (Chuck E. Live Stage) and [Video Wall]({{< ref "wiki/Video Wall.md" >}}).

## History ##
Waldorf opened on June 18, 2012 as a relocation of the old store, which had brought the Studio C Alpha to the new store. It had a very unique entrance area, which had a set of emergency exit doors right by the main entrance doors. It also opened with the 2010 update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative, which included early 2010s decor, Skytubes, and the Studio C Alpha stage. In the mid-late 2010s, however, the Skytubes were removed and were replaced with more kid games and rides. As of September 2023, the store remains open to this day.
