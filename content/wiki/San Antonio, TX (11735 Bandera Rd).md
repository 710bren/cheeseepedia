**_San Antonio, TX (11735 Bandera Rd)**_ is a Chuck E. Cheese's that opened on April 16th, 2002 with a Studio C Beta.

##Stages##
This location opened with a Studio C Beta, the newest stage show for Chuck E. Cheese’s at that time,  featuring the 32-movement Chuck E. Cheese animatronic created by Garner Holt Productions. The stage would remain in average condition with the Ticket Blaster being moved in front of the blue screen and the light box removed once 2 out of 3 of the original monitors were replaced with newer TVs in the 2010s. In early 2022, most of the animatronics movements would stop functioning, with only 8 out of the 32 movements functional. Notably, the nose cylinder would break at some point, causing the animatronic to have a drooping nose.

##2016 Car Crash##

##History##
In November 2000, CEC Entertainment would purchase land in San Antonio, Texas described as 'Lot 9, Block 6, County Block 4429, Bandera Exchange', it is unknown if this was the planned location for the Bandera Rd store, [San Antonio (Stone Oak), TX (1403 N Loop)]({{< ref "wiki/San Antonio (Stone Oak), TX (1403 N Loop).md" >}}), or an entirely scrapped store. 

The land the Bandera Rd Chuck E. Cheese's would be built on was purchased in October 2001, with the store opening on April 16th, 2002. After opening, the store would remain untouched aside from the game package changing and the original can lights being replaced with flourescent lights in Feburary/March 2011. 

In Summer 2015, the store recieved the 2015 remodel package. The skytubes would be removed during the remodel.
