**Middleburg Heights, OH (6920 W 130th St)** was a Pizza Time Theatre located in Middleburg Heights, OH. It was part of the Southland Shopping Center.

## History ##

### Pizza Time Theater ###
The Middleburg Heights Pizza Time Theatre opened in May 1981 with a [Balcony Stage.]({{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage.md" >}}) Unfortunately there is one photo of it but no videos exist of this location as a PTT. The location would end up closing in 1986.

### Marc's Funtime ###
The location was purchased by Marc Glassman, owner of the Marc's Grocery Store chain, and converted to the first Marc's Funtime Pizza Palace.  The new location opened in 1987, keeping the original balcony stage, flag wavers, and band board, but retrofitting the Pizza Time Players to the 'Marc's Funtime Band'. The location also featured a Click / Murray D. Bird (Animatronic) (Click) animatronic from Showbiz Pizza Place.

### Closure ###
Marc's Funtime would end up closing before 2003, with the original plaza being demolished to make way for a BJ's Wholesale Club. It is unknown what happened to the animatronics. Click would be kept on display at the Marc's location until 2016, when it was destroyed.
