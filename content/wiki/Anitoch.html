<p><b><i>Antioch</b></i> is one of the prop characters in the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Rock-afire Explosion" >}}">Rock-afire Explosion</a>, having made his debut as an animatronic at <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Jacksonville, FL (9820 Atlantic Blvd)" >}}">Jacksonville, FL (9820 Atlantic Blvd)</a>.</p>
<p><h2> History </h2></p>
<p><h3> Origins & Showbiz Pizza Place </h3></p>
<p>Antioch was originally referred to as the Birthday Spider, and held a cake in-between his hands. Over time, he would become <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Fatz Geronimo (Animatronic)" >}}">Fatz Geronimo</a>'s pet spider. He would pop down occasionally and speak to Fatz in a garbled language that only they could understand. During <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Concept Unification" >}}">Concept Unification</a>, Antioch would be destroyed. Antioch was named after the first Showbiz Pizza Place location in <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Kansas City, MO (2726 NE Vivion Rd)" >}}">Kansas City, MO (2726 NE Vivion Rd)</a>.</p>
<p><h3> Present Day </h3></p>
<p>Original parts for Antioch would start to be reproduced by Creative Engineering's new employees in 2023.</p>
