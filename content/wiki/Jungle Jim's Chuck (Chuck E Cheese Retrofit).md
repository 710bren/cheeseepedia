<h2> History </h2>
Chuck originally came from the [Cincinnati, OH (11400 Princeton Pike)]({{< ref "wiki/Cincinnati, OH (11400 Princeton Pike).md" >}}) Pizza Time Theatre and was bought by Jungle Jim's after the location closed in the Fall of 1984.<ref>[Cincinnati, OH (11400 Princeton Pike)]({{< ref "wiki/Cincinnati, OH (11400 Princeton Pike).md" >}})</ref>  Chuck was first installed in 1995 and was located atop the 'S.S. Minnow' along with Jungle Jim's Fatz (Fatz Retrofit) & Jungle Jim's Billy Bob (Billy Bob Retrofit).<ref>https:<i>imgur.com/a/dN5V9fY</ref> They would sing songs such as 'Johnny Be Good'.  When first installed in 1995 the mask had minor modifications those being changing the fabric of the snout and jaw to be much brighter.<ref>https:</i>imgur.com/a/SiK7Gcu</ref> Legs were added making him a full-bodied drummer. He wore a black vest and green pants with a yellow stripe going down the leg.<ref>https://imgur.com/a/CRXSMRT</ref>

In 1997 when Jungle Jim's was beginning to retrofit the Nirobi Trio to be more sea themed with Chuck being the last who was turned into a Lobster.<ref>https:<i>imgur.com/a/RX2Zn5j</ref><ref>https:</i>imgur.com/a/kyWwuE7</ref> By the Fall of 1998 the retrofit was fully finished.<ref>https:<i>imgur.com/a/twbrigh</ref><ref>https:</i>imgur.com/G1tTgTY</ref> 

In 1999 the Nirobi Trio was removed and replaced with the Cereal Bowl Band.<ref>https:<i>imgur.com/a/Qk3elHB</ref><ref>https:</i>www.flickr.com/photos/junglejims/354036295/in/album-72157594477885672/</ref> While it is unknown what happened the Fatz & Billy Bob retrofits what is known is that by November 2002 the mask of the PTT Chuck head with a mannequin of sorts to display the mask. It is unknown as to when it was installed but most likely in 1997 once the Lobster retrofit was installed. It was located roughly where the 'EXOTIC MEATS' is located today.<ref>https://www.flickr.com/photos/tskirvin/3129699927/</ref> In 2004 Jungle Jim's expanded again which meant the removal of the Chuck mask. As of today the only remains of the Nirobi Trio at Jungle Jim's is newspaper clippings on the wall located near checkout.
