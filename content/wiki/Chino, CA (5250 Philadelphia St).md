## History ##
Chino opened on December 30, 1988 under the name _Showbiz Pizza_, the 1986 SPT Remodel Program (1988 remodel), and [Chuck E.'s House]({{< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House.md" >}}). Around 1994, they received [Phase 1]({{< ref "wiki/Phase 1 (1994).md" >}}), which involved removing all 1988 remodel elements, removing neon signage, changing the exterior to _Chuck E. Cheese's_, and replaced [Chuck E.'s House]({{< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House.md" >}}) with a [2-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/2-Stage.md" >}}). They later received [Phase 2]({{< ref "wiki/Phase 2 (1997).md" >}}) and [Phase 3]({{< ref "wiki/Phase 3 (2000).md" >}}) in their respective years. In 2006/2007, they received the 2005 update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative, removing all 90s decor for new decor, removing the showroom walls and balcony seating, added purple walls, downsized the [Skytubes]({{< ref "wiki/Skytubes.md" >}}),  and changed the exterior again. The [Skytubes]({{< ref "wiki/Skytubes.md" >}}) were removed around 2017-2020. Chino remained like this until November 2022, when they would begin the 2017 2.0 Remodel Program (2.0 remodel), removing the [2-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/2-Stage.md" >}}) for a 2021 Model Chuck E. Live Stage (Dance Floor) (Dance Floor) and [Video Wall]({{< ref "wiki/Video Wall.md" >}}). As of July 2023, Chino remains like this.
