The **TIME Space Race (Magazine)** was a poster created for Chuck E. Cheese's around 1994-1995 for the [1990s Major Remodel]({{< ref "wiki/1990s Major Remodel.md" >}}).

## Design ##
The poster is held in a 20Â½ in. by 17 in. dark blue/red picture frame. The main photo of the poster depicts the Chuck Statue - Astronaut (shelf item) which has Chuck E. Cheese in a Astronaut outfit with him holding his helmet on his right hand. This poster is a parody of the space race magazines, which were a big event during the time period when these posters were being made.
