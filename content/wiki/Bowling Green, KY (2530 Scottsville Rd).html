<p>This location was the last Pizza Time Theatre opened in Kentucky, and the shortest-lived CEC in Kentucky as well.</p>

<p><h2>History</h2></p>
<p>The Bowling Green, Kentucky Pizza Time Theatre opened on April 17, 1984 on 2530 Scottsville Road in Bowling Green, at the Old Hickory Building. Not much is known about this location, as it was incredibly short-lived. as the store closed in 1986, it is currently not known what month, but presumed to be in late April-early May as a newspaper says that an auction was to take place on May 17, 1986 (9 years after the first PTT opened at <a href="{{< ref "wiki/San Jose, CA (370 S Winchester Blvd)" >}}">San Jose, California (370 S Winchester Blvd)</a> starting at 10:00 AM. It is unknown if anything from the auction still exists in the hands of private collectors today.</p>
<p>On April 27, 2004, 20 years and 10 days after the PTT opened, a new Chuck E. Cheese's opened in Bowling Green, this time on <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Bowling Green, KY (2625 Scottsville Rd)" >}}">2625 Scottsville Road</a>, at the Greenwood Mall (which is across the street from the Old Hickory Building), that location is still open to this day, and received the 2.0 remodel in June and July of 2022.</p>
<p><h3>After Closure</h3></p>
<p>As of 2022, the former Pizza Time Theatre in Bowling Green is now a RE/MAX Real Estate Executives business, and the Old Hickory Building is still standing, there are a couple of businesses including a Complete Nutrition, and a hair salon.</p>
<p><h2>Stages</h2></p>
<p>The Bowling Green PTT opened with the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage" >}}">Balcony Stage</a>, as every PTT had (except for the few early PTT's between 1977-1980) they never got another stage since the store closed in 1986. There are no public photos of the Bowling Green Pizza Time Theatre except for one single black and white photo of The King (shown above).</p>
