<b><i>York, PA (351 Loucks Rd)</b></i> was a <i>Pizza Time Theatre</i> location that opened on August 23, 1983 and closed on February 19, 1984 with a Balcony Stage and unknown cabaret/lounge acts. Very little is known about this location, mainly because it was either undocumented, or short lived.

This location is not to be confused with the [current location]({{< ref "wiki/York, PA (2801 E Market St).md" >}}), which opened on March 4, 1983 as a Showbiz Pizza Place, received CU in 1991, and is still open today with the 2.0 remodel.

<h2>History</h2>
Not much is currently known about this location, other than it opened on August 23, 1983 with a Balcony Stage in the Crossroads shopping center. It closed on February 19, 1984, making it one of the very few PTTs to close before the March 1984 bankruptcy. The building became many different businesses, and as of June 2023, they are still there.

<h2>Stages</h2>
York opened and closed with a Balcony Stage, and had some unknown cabaret acts. After closure, their fate is unknown.
