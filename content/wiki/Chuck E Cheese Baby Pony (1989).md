## Design ##
The pony uses the at the time new Baby Pony mold from the Play & Care Sets line.<ref>http://mylittlewiki.org/wiki/Category:Play_and_Care_Sets</ref> The body used the standard Dark Pink color, and the hair with a blue color. The eyes were painted green, and the design (later colloquially referred to as a _Cutie Mark_)<ref>https://www.mlptp.net/index.php?threads/the-term-cutie-mark.112921/</ref> was white lineart of a standard Chuck E. Cheese artwork with white text below it reading 'Chuck E. Cheese'- taken from the _Pizza Time Theatre_ logo.

The pony came in a plastic **_My Little Pony**_ branded bag with no other accessories. This is similar to the Mail Order Ponies that were available which came in unlabeled plastic bags, causing later confusion that the CEC pony was also mail order.<ref>http://mylittlewiki.org/wiki/G1_Birthflower_Ponies</ref>
