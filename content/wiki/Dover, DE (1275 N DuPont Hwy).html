<h2> History </h2>
Dover opened on December 27, 2002, as the last of 3 Small-Town Studio C Prototype stages and the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Phase 3 (2000)" >}}">Phase 3</a> remodel. Around 2005, the location received a minor remodel, removing the Small-Town Studio C Prototype stage for a Small-Town Studio C|Studio C Cappa stage. Between 2009 and 2011, the dim lighting was removed, and the exterior was replaced with a standard <a href="{{< ref "wiki/CEC 2005 Remodel Program" >}}">CEC 2005 Remodel Program</a> exterior. The <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Skytubes" >}}">Skytubes</a> were also removed somewhere presumably in 2019. In 2023, the store received the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/CEC 2018 20 Remodel Program" >}}">CEC 2018 2.0 Remodel Program</a>, removing the Cappa for a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Chuck E Live Stage (Dance Floor)" >}}">Dance Floor</a> + <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Video Wall" >}}">Video Wall</a>. As of October 2023, Dover remains like this.
