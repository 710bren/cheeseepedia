**308 E Northern Lights Blvd** was a Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre that opened on 1982 (month and day currently unknown) with a Balcony Stage, which is still open to this day.

This location has been the only location in the state of Alaska since the Fairbanks, Alaska (600 Old Steese Hwy) location closed in 1988.

## History ##
This store was the first to open in the state of Alaska, opening in 1982 (month and day unknown) and originally had a Balcony Stage, they would be franchised until January 2, 2005, when they would be acquired by CEC Entertainment, becoming a company-owned store. They would go through several remodels, remodeling to the 2005 Remodel in the 2000's, and remodeling to the 2.0 Remodel in July 2022. The building is 2 stories, being larger than most normal CEC's.

## Stages ##
Originally when the store opened, they had a Balcony Stage, as all other Pizza Time Theatres did, they would have it for a few years until the late 80's / early 90's, when they would receive a C-Stage, they would have it for a short time until the mid 1990's, when they would receive a 2-Stage, they would have it for a little bit, until sometime in the 2000's, when they would replace it with a Studio C Beta, 16M. They would have the Beta for many years, until July 2022, when they would remove the Beta for a Dance Floor and Video Wall, as a part of the 2.0 Remodel. As of October 2022, they still have the Dance Floor.
