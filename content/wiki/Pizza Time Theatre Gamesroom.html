<b><i>Pizza Time Theatre Gamesroom</b></i> is one of the first <i>Pizza Time Theatre</i> training tapes, released in December of 1981, and used until sometime in 1984.

The tape focused on the managing of the games room portion of an employee's job, being put on a film cartridge with no audio.
<h2>PTT Training Center</h2>
The tape was part of the [PTT Training Center & Test Kitchen]({{< ref "wiki/PTT Training Center & Test Kitchen.html" >}}) program held exclusively at the [San Jose, CA (2445 Fontaine Rd)]({{< ref "wiki/San Jose, CA (2445 Fontaine Rd).html" >}}) location, potentially meaning only one copy was ever made. The tape was also part of a set of training tapes, with the only other one known being the [Pizza Time Theatre Cashiering]({{< ref "wiki/Pizza Time Theatre Cashiering.html" >}}) tape.
