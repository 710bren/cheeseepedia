Santa On Stage Show 1984 was a continuation of the {{< wiki-link "Santa On Stage Show 1983 (Event)">}} at a different set of stores. This event lasted from sometime in December of 1984 to January of 1985, different timings from the previous year.

<h2> Store Appearances </h2>
One store would be confirmed to have kept Klunk from the previous <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Santa On Stage Show 1983 (Event)" >}}">Santa On Stage Show 1983</a> event. This is only by confirmation that they had the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Country Klunk (Event)" >}}">Country Klunk</a> event, which is presumed to always have coincided with stores<ref name=':1'>Country Klunk tape filmed there. </ref><ul><li><a href="{{< ref "wiki/North Richland Hills, TX (7935 Grapevine Hwy)" >}}">North Richland Hills, TX (7935 Grapevine Hwy)</a><sup>(1)</sup></li></ul>
Two other stores are inferred to have had this event due to showing Country Klunk, though it is unknown if Kedzie received a traveling Klunk, or obtained one from Farmington Hills, MI (29955 Orchard Lake Rd) with all the other animatronics they obtained from their closure.<ul><li><a href="{{< ref "wiki/Fresno, CA (3117 W Shaw Ave)" >}}">Fresno, CA (3117 W Shaw Ave)</a><sup>(1)</sup></li><li><a href="{{< ref "wiki/Chicago, IL (5030 S Kedzie Ave)" >}}">Chicago, IL (5030 S Kedzie Ave)</a><ref name=':15'>Klunk sign mechs found in ceiling area. </ref></li></ul>
Five stores are confirmed to have done this event, but aren't confirmed if they had previously had Klunk, or had newly received them for the event.<ul><li>Bremerton, WA (4060 Wheaton Way)<sup>(2)</sup></li><li>West St. Paul, MN (1422 S Robert St)<ref name=':14'>https://www.newspapers.com/article/star-tribune/39032432/</ref></li><li>St. Paul, MN (1624 White Bear Ave)<sup>(14)</sup></li><li>Minneapolis, MN (5939 John Martin Dr)<sup>(14)</sup></li><li>Bloomington, MN (7989 Southtown Dr)<sup>(14)</sup></li></ul>
<h3> Unconfirmed Stores </h3>
Two stores had some sort of Klunk part discovered at their location. Springfield with Klunk valves, and Davenport with a Klunk arm. This confirms Klunk was present at their store at some point, but it is unknown which event(s) he was used in. Davenport does mention potentially receiving a Klunk for 1983 however.<ref name=':0'>https://www.newspapers.com/image/665684553/?clipping_id=55395460&fcfToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJmcmVlLXZpZXctaWQiOjY2NTY4NDU1MywiaWF0IjoxNjk2OTcwNDk0LCJleHAiOjE2OTcwNTY4OTR9.sClG1OZrf2KnRIxRDXP7BAdtVpv1p4YKdgIgIRQHA4Q</ref><ul><li><a href="{{< ref "wiki/Springfield, OH (2345 Valley Loop Rd)" >}}">Springfield, OH (2345 Valley Loop Rd)</a><sup>(3)</sup></li><li><a href="{{< ref "wiki/Davenport, IA (903 E Kimberly Rd)" >}}">Davenport, IA (903 E Kimberly Rd)</a><sup>(4)</sup><sup>(0)</sup></li></ul>
