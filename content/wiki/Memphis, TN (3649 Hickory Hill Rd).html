<h2>History </h2>
Memphis (Hickory Hill) opened its doors on August 24th, 1982 as the 3rd Showbiz Pizza Place in Tennessee. They originally featured the Rock-Afire Explosion, as all other Showbiz locations did. It was originally a franchised-owned store. Like many other ShowBiz Pizza locations, it had a typical SPP layout seen in many other stores across the United States and would eventually receive the 1988 remodel years after it would open. Fortunately, some documentation exists back in the ShowBiz days. Like many ShowBiz locations in the late 1980s, Memphis (Hickory Hill) received the Showbiz Pizza Campground upgrade.
In around 1991/1992, Memphis (Hickory Hill) received Concept Unification which converted the show to Munch's Make Believe Band. They also received Phase 2 and a new exterior. In around the Mid-Late 1990's, Memphis (Hickory Hill) received another remodel which removed some early 90's decor and added new decor and SkyTubes.  On September 16, 1996, the store was acquired by Corporate alongside 18 other locations including the other location on <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Memphis, TN (3268 Austin Peay Hwy)" >}}">Austin Peay Hwy</a>. Memphis (Hickory Hill) remained this way until around 2014, they received the 2013 Update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative which involved removing the Showroom Walls, balcony Seating, and received a new exterior and also removing older 90's decor. They would remain like this until their closure on October 27th 2020 due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. After their closure they would remain abandoned for a few months until in 2021 when a 'Crazy Hot Deals' moved in. Currently, as of February 2023, they still exist.
