<h2>History</h2>
<h3> Pre-CEC (August 21st, 1962 - 1977) </h3>
The original Chuck E. Cheese in Hampton, VA was originally a part of the GEX. It closed in 1977 and the portion became abandoned for 6 years until the CEC moved to the former space in May 1982.
<h3> Chuck E. Cheese (May 1982 - May 2002) </h3>
Hampton opened its doors in May 1982 with a Balcony Stage. It was originally a franchised-owned Pizza Time Theatre location. In 1989/1990, Hampton would receive the 1988 remodel and removed older decor for newer decor, an exterior change, and the removal of the Balcony Stage for Chuck E.'s House Facade. In the Early 90's, Hampton would receive a minor remodel, this time another change to the exterior, older decor removed for newer ones, and Chuck E.'s House Facade being removed for the 2-Stage. In the Late 90's, they would receive yet another remodel, which changed the exterior again, and added SkyTubes. Hampton remained like this until 2002 when they relocated. After they relocated, Hampton was abandoned for a year or two until they became a clothing store named Citi Trends. The exterior sign was changed in 2016. Currently, as of February 2023, the Citi Trends is still there with the Chuck E. Cheese's logo label scar intact although very hard to see due to old age. The text where it used to read 'Chuck E. Cheese's' is long gone as it has faded completely.
<h2>Stages</h2>
When Hampton opened, it housed a Balcony Stage like the other Pizza Time Theatres that opened at the time.<sup>(1)</sup> Sometime in 1989/1990 they converted the Balcony Stage into <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House Facade" >}}">Chuck E.â€™s House Facade</a>, otherwise known as the C-Stage. This location would get a 2-Stage installed in 1993
In May 2002, Hampton relocated to their current location and their 2-Stage was sent to Florence, KY until they got 2.0 in March 2022.
