Jungle Jim's International Market (Also known as just Jungle Jim's) is a chain of grocery stores in the Cincinnati, Ohio area founded by "Jungle" Jim Bonaminio. The stores are known for being large in size, containing a large selection of domestic and foreign foods. They also contain various displays and attractions, including various animatronics both created for the store and purchased from other locations in Ohio. 

<h2> Detailed History & Events </h2>
<h3> 1971</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Jim Bonaminio sets up his first semi-permanent produce stand. Located on the corner of Erie Blvd and High Street in Hamilton, this stand is set up on a former used car lot. The stand reportedly made $200 a week.<sup>(1)</sup><sup>(2)</sup></li>
</ul>
<h3> 1972</h3>
<ul>
        <li>Jim would move his stand to a new location in Mariemont, over 30 miles south of Hamilton. This location featured screen doors and windows, as well as a proper roof. A gas station on property was converted into a place for Jim and his family to live. <sup>(2)</sup>
<li>Later in the year the stand would move again, this time back north to the corner of Route 4 and Symmes Road in Fairfield. <sup>(2)</sup></li>
</ul>
<h3> 1973</h3>
<ul> <li>Jim was getting used to moving the stand around often, The traffic his business brought made the vacant lots it was placed on much more desirable to developers, who would buy the land and force Jungle Jim's to move. <sup>(1)</sup><sup>(2)</sup></li>
<li> After setting up a temporary location at 1215 Main St on the west side of Hamilton, the stand would move back to Fairfield on Route 4, this time across from the Fisher Body manufacturing plant. <sup>(2)</sup></li>
</ul>
<h3> 1974</h3>
<ul> <li> Jim would purchase a piece of property in Fairfield from Jim Ivers and Bruce Cunagin to build a permanent year-round location for Jungle Jim's. Jim didn't have any credit and refused to have his parents be his co-signers, Bruce's mom Fanny would step up and co-sign for him. <sup>(1)</sup><sup>(2)</sup></li>
</ul>
<h3> 1975</h3>
<ul> <li> The store had issues getting the proper permits from the city, since the land was zoned for industrial use. The biggest argument for Jungle Jim's to operate was that an exemption to the zoning had been made for an Arthur Treacher's Fish & Chips location that had been built nearby. Esther Benzing, president of Fairfieldâ€™s planning commission, reportedly told Jim "good luck son" after approving the store to operate. <sup>(1)</sup><sup>(2)</sup></li>
<li> The location at {{< wiki-link "Fairfield, OH (5440 Dixie Hwy)" >}} opens sometime during this year. The store is only 4,200 square feet. Today, this area is the Health and Beauty department. <sup>(1)</sup></li>
</ul>
<h3> 1982</h3>
<ul> <li> The store receives its first major expansion, adding more general grocery items like milk and bread to the produce selection, and bringing the store to 15,000 square feet. <sup>(2)</sup><sup>(3)</sup></li>
</ul>
<h3> 1983</h3>
<ul> <li> Jim has a pond filled with animal statues and palm trees constructed Infront of the store. This was intended to make visiting Jungle Jim's an experience for the whole family, as well as making the store more recognizable.<sup>(3)</sup></li>
