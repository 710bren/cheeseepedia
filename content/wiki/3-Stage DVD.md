TODO.

## Format ##
Control data for the show is stored as a biphase mark code signal on one channel of the show DVD. The BMC signal is an encoded form of 4800 baud 8-N-1 serial data. The data is command-based and includes control data for the show's air valves, in addition to show metadata and commands to stop and start show segments, control the A/V switcher, etc. All data in the serial stream fits within the printable ASCII range.

TODO: notes about how this is largely the same for cyberamic stage, history of the format, etc. Really think this should be its own page, once I go into full format detail it's going to be a crazy amount of duplicated data
