334 E 31st St was the Rockafire Bar, a barcade located in Kansas City, MO


The barcade opened on May 24th, 2018, and closed February 25th, 2019.

## The Stage ##
Rockafire Bar featured an unique stage. The stage was located in the northwest corner of the building and took the shape of an L.
The stage featured all of the rockafire explosion characters except for Antioch, Sun, Moon, Choo-Choo, and Looney Bird.

Props the stage featured were Rolfe's Applause sign, the RAE sign, some cutout trees, An 'Used and Abused Tars' sign (seen on the mini stage), and Billy Bob's gas pump (fitted with a color changing LED). 

Beach Bear had an unique look, as he featured a blue collar and a white wig (which was later removed).

The computer that ran the show sat on the desk directly behind Rolfe.

Later between August and October 2018, a mural was painted on the walls behind the stage, which included all of the missing characters (except for antioch) and props.
