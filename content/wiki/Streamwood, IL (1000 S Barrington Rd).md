## History ##
In June 2014, Streamwood relocated here for larger space. The new location opened on June 6 of the same year. It has the 2013 update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative, which included 'Phase 5' decor and a bot-less Circles of Light stage. This location was left untouched except for new game packages. New Streamwood remains open to this day.

## Animatronics ##
No animatronics were ever used at this location, making it a 'bot-less' store.
