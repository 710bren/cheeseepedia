The **_Winchester Chuck E. Cheese Nameplate**_ was only used at the first Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre on [\2](\1) located in the Town & Country Shopping Center in San Jose, California; for the purpose of identifying the [\2](\1) from 1977 to 1980.

##  Production ## 
Production of the Winchester nameplates do not have any specific data documented on them outside of speculation, however we can assume Chuck E. Cheese's nameplate was the first produced in the batch of Winchester nameplates due to the significance of the character and was produced by either Fantasy Forest or Atari Incorporated from July to August 1977. If production was not headed by Harold Guldbrandsen's company, it was either produced at Atari Incorporated or in house at store. If production was carried out by Fantasy Forest, it can assumed each Winchester nameplate was sent out alongside the Helen Henny animatronic as earlier photos of the location do not showcase the nameplates. 

##  Usage ## 
The only appearance of this nameplate was at the 370 South Winchester Boulevard location, where it was placed on the bottom section of Chuck E. Cheese's portrait from presumably August 1977 to an unknown month in 1980. Once it had completed its run, several scenarios could have played out, those being:

* **A.** _The nameplate was sent to Sunnyvale alongside the other Winchester portrait characters._
* **B.** _Kept in storage at the location itself and destroyed._
* **C.** _Kept in storage at the location itself and auctioned off._

##  Design ## 
Chuck E. Cheese's nameplate is pretty much identical to the other Winchester nameplates at the time, with the exception of Helen Hennys nameplate, each Winchester nameplate used a rounded wooden board with the characters name in white text in the center, enclosed in a thin yellow border. Chuck E. Cheese's nameplate was no different, with the only difference being the text was changed to 'CHUCK E. CHEESE'
