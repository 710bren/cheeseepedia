**_22940 Van Owen St i**_s a Chuck E. Cheese that opened in June 23, 1992 as a corporate location with a Road Stage which is still open to this day.

## History## 
West Hills opened on June 23rd, 1992 as a corporate-owned location. West Hills opened with the 1988 Remodel including the CU decor, the ball pit, the Blue and White awnings, the checkers around the store, and the Road Stage. Around the mid-late 1990s, They replaced the logo with Coach Chuck and removed older 90's decor for newer decor, the Blue and White awnings, some checkers around the store, and the removal of the ball pit for SkyTubes. West Hills remained like this until in 2006, when they received the 2005 remodel (Phase 4) which involved the removal of the showroom walls, removing older decor for newer decor, new booths, relocating the stage, & adding purple walls. West Hills still remains like this. Currently, as of February 2023, the location still has the 2005 Remodel and the Road Stage.
## Stages## 
Like all Road Stages at the time, Chuck wore his Tuxedo & Derby outfit. Up and Down curtains were added by the Late 90's. In the Early 2000's, this was replaced with the Cool Chuck outfit. By the Late 2000's, Chuck's outfit was replaced with the Avenger outfit. Up and Down curtains were later removed.

As of February 2023, West Hills still has the Road Stage and 2005 Remodel.
