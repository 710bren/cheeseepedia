<h2> History </h2>

<h2>= Pre-CEC </h2>=
Before the store's opening it originally opened as a Big Lots, which closed in 2020 presumably due to relocation.<ref>https://www.loopnet.com/Listing/525-785-W-Craig-Rd-North-Las-Vegas-NV/16188564/</ref> Plans about the store's construction appeared as early as April 2023, with construction beginning in September 2023.

On January 19th, 2024, the store would have a soft opening, later hosting a Grand Reopening celebration on January 31st. The store also installed a special fixture on the exterior of the building, promoting the store's Trampoline Zone.
