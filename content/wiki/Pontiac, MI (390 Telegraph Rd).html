<b><i>390 Telegraph Rd, Store #337</b></i> was a <i>Chuck E. Cheese's</i> that opened on September 20th, 1993 with a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/1-Stage" >}}">1-Stage</a>, which closed in Summer 2008.
This store was the only in Michigan with a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/1-Stage" >}}">1-Stage</a>, and would keep it until closure.
<h2>Stages</h2>
The only stage this store had was the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/1-Stage" >}}">1-Stage</a>. Little to no footage of this store has surfaced so it's condition by closure is unknown, but it's presumed the show was trashed in Summer 2008 when the store closed. It is also presumed they replaced the Tuxedo Chuck outfit with the Avenger Chuck outfit.
<h2>History</h2>
This store opened in the Oakland Pointe Center on September 20th, 1993 with a 1-Stage. This store also had the 1992 Major Remodel, which was new at the time. They would stay like this until they presumably got one of the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Phase 1 (1994)" >}}">Phase 1</a>, <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Phase 2 (1997)" >}}">2</a>, or <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Phase 3 (2000)" >}}">3</a> remodels. They would stay with the main base design they had until they closed in Summer 2008 for unknown reasons, presumably lease or something else. They would stay abandoned for a few months until they were converted into a culinary school branch of Dorsey Schools, a nearby business in the same center. They would close in 2019-2020. As of August 2023, the former space is vacant once again.
