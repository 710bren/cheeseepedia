<b>2625 Scottsville Road #300, Store #567</b> was a {{< wiki-link "Chuck E Cheese's" >}} that opened on April 27, 2004 with a {{< wiki-link "Studio C Cappa">}}</wiki-link>, which is still open to this day. It is located in the Greenwood Mall.
This location received the 2.0 Remodel in June 2022.
<h2> History </h2>
In February 2004, the Bowling Green Daily News reported that new stores would be coming to the Greenwood Mall in 2004, including Old Navy, Yankee Candle, and Chuck E. Cheese's.<sup>(1)</sup> On April 27th, 2004, the Chuck E. Cheese's of Bowling Green opened, located next to JCPenney. Originally when the store opened, they had the late 1990s remodel and a {{<wiki-link "Studio C Cappa">}}, which was the only one installed in Kentucky. They would have the Chuck E.'s Clubhouse version of the SkyTubes from opening until around late 2015, when they would remove it. The store would stay mostly the same until June of 2022, when they would start the 2.0 Remodel.
<h3> Chuck E. Cheese (2.0) June 2022 - Present </h3>
Sometime in June of 2022, the Chuck E. Cheese's in Bowling Green started their {{< wiki-link "CEC 2018 2.0 Remodel"}}. As of October 2024, they still have this remodel.
In August 2024, the store would receive the Trampoline Zone, moving some games from the kiddie area into the main game area to make room for the Trampoline Zone, and rearranging other games in the main game area to accomodate for the newly moved games.
<h3> Other Events </h3>
In August 2015, a police officer was denied service at the location for carrying their firearm. The officer was wearing a police marked polo shirt. It is believed an employee misunderstood the policy, which allows uniformed officers to carry their firearm into the restaurant.<sup>(2)</sup>
<h2> Stages </h2>
When the Bowling Green location opened, they had a Small-Town Studio C. in the late 2000s or early 2010s, the Cool Chuck shirt would be replaced with the Avenger shirt. In late 2013 the hat would be removed. Around 2017 the khaki shorts would be replaced with the Rockstar jeans. In early July 2022, the Studio C Cappa would be removed and replaced with a Chuck E. Live Stage and Video Wall. As of October 2024, they still have the Chuck E. Live Stage and Video Wall.
