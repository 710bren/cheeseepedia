<h2> Production </h2>
This show started out as a Christmas showtape called [CEC Home for the Holidays]({{< ref "wiki/CEC Home for the Holidays.md" >}}) in late 1987, originally on reel it later got a Cyberstar version two years later as Christmas '89. The major difference between the 1989 and 1990 versions are the copyrighted music for the intermissions countdowns, other than that the shows are remotely the same.

<h2>= Road Stage Version </h2>=
The 1990 release would be the first ever showtape released for the [Road Stage]({{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Road Stage.md" >}}), having new programming made in the [Animation Programming System]({{< ref "wiki/Animation Programming System.md" >}}). This would be the only full showtape to have been programmed in [SongCode]({{< ref "wiki/SongCode.md" >}}) and APS.

<h2>=APS Files</h2>=
The show was a part of the [1990-1992 APS Floppy Cases]({{< ref "wiki/1990-1992 APS Floppy Cases.md" >}}), being the second tape known to be made using APS. It would be split across three disks, overlapping with the [CEC Jan '91]({{< ref "wiki/CEC Jan '91.md" >}}) disk.

<h2>== Floppy Alteration </h2>==
Noticeably all three floppies were changed after their initial archival, as evidenced by their labels and file dates. Originally, the Christmas '90 tape was stored on the first two floppies, with segments 1-3 on the first, and 4 + Birthday Wave on the second. The January '91 tape also only included the original first 3 segments. This is all marked on the floppies in red pen during their creation in October of 1990. On December 6th, this would be changed to have the Birthday Wave segment moved to the Jan '91 disk, replacing it with the 1990 Live Show for Road Stage. All file extensions would also change to '.ROA', being originally an unknown acronym '.ATL'. All these changes would be written in blue marker on the labels, alongside new text across all three floppies noting them being APS files. This moving around was likely done just to save space on the disks.

<h2>== Files </h2>==
(All files were originally given the extention '.ATL' before being changed to '.ROA' on December 6, 1990.)

The entry '#daywave.atl' was recovered from a deleted section of the disk, with the pound sign in its name denoting deletion. The floppy label sources the full name, being 'bdaywave.atl'. This version is identical to the version found on the Jan '91 disk.
