<b><i>Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Factory</b></i> is an <i>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easy-Bake_Oven Easy-Bake Oven]</i> styled pizza maker released in 1999.

The product was made by <i>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wham-O Wham-O]</i> and stayed in production for an undetermined amount of time. A similar product, Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Maker Play Set, would show up later using <i>Avenger Chuck</i><nowiki/>'s design, being made by <i>EZ-2 Make.</i>

<h2> Description </h2>
The product would come with the oven, which had a storage shelf built into its side, along with two pizza trays, a claw to grab the trays out of the oven, a plastic pizza cutter, and four <i>Chuck E. Cheese's</i> tokens. No pizza ingredients were included, requiring the purchase of Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Factory Refills. These refills would be enough to make two pizzas, though also came with 10 free <i>Chuck E. Cheese's</i> tickets inside.

The ingredients included were referred to as:

* <i>Scrumptious Sauce Packets</i>
* <i>Super-Duper Dough Packets</i>
* <i>Zippy Cheese Packets</i>
* <i>Tasty Pepperoni Packet</i>

<h2> Commercials </h2>
Two variations of an ad were put on TV around the time. One starting with 'How much cheese can you put on a Chuck E. Cheese pizza?', and the other with 'Wanna make Chuck E. Cheese pizza?'.
