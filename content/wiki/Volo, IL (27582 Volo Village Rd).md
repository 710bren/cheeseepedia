**_Volo Museum**_ is a museum located at _27582 Volo Village Rd, Volo, IL_.

## Stages## 
Volo features multiple animatronic shows, including [\2](\1), [\2](\1), [\2](\1), the [\2](\1), and the [\2](\1).

## History## 
Volo Museum would receive their first animatronic show, the Enchanted Forest Pirate Show, in around 2014. It would be fully restored and operational by 2015, residing in ShowBiz Pizza Place (Not to be confused with the actual [[ShowBiz Pizza Place]].) 

In 2018, Volo purchased The Beagles from Craigslist, and installed it next to the Pirate Show. Volo would also purchase a complete Rock-afire Explosion show around this time but was not able to install it due to not having a feasible location or a license. The show would be the same show that appeared at the Florida Film Festival in 2009 for the premiere of the [[The Rock-afire Explosion Documentary]]. Volo would also receive the tree backdrops, Antioch mech, and valances from the Libertyville [[Chimpy's Pizza Safari]].

In 2019, Volo would purchase the Four Little Shavers, The King, and King Kat. The Shavers would be restored by Layton and installed where The Beagles formally were. The King and King Kat would be restored by Jared (The King ETT), and placed inside Showroom #4 in the museum along with The Beagles, who received a slight refurbishment. 

In February of 2024, it was announced that Volo Museum and [[Creative Engineering]] came to an agreement and Volo was granted a license to operate the show publicly. A building was built to house the show, and installation began on February 24. The show premieres on June 1, 2024 at 12:00 PM local time.
