TODO: Format used in Rock-afire Explosion shows at Showbiz Pizza Places for video diagnostics. Video would output to external monitor, and signals/audio would somehow bypass the tape deck and feed into the [Grey Box]({{< ref "wiki/Grey Box.md" >}}). Only 3 tapes are known to have been in this format, the [1981 Diagnostics Tape]({{< ref "wiki/1981 Diagnostics Tape.md" >}}), [Showbiz Pizza Calibration Video Tape]({{< ref "wiki/Showbiz Pizza Calibration Video Tape.md" >}}), and [Uncle Klunk Diagnostic Tape]({{< ref "wiki/Uncle Klunk Diagnostic Tape.md" >}})
