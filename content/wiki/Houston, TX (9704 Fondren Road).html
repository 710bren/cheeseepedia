<p><h2> History </h2></p>
<p>Houston, TX (Fondren) opened in 1982 as a Pizza Time Theater with a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage" >}}">Balcony Stage</a> and had the 1981 remodel. This location has no pictures from when it was open. It is not confirmed if they had The King or Dolli Dimples. Unfortunately it closed in 1984 for underperformance. After closure, the building was abandoned with a 'Saba's' and a daycare taking over part of the former space. A barbershop took over the entrance. Years later, the barbershop closed and still sits vacant to this day.</p>
<p><h2> Stages </h2></p>
<p>When they were opened, they only had a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage" >}}">Balcony Stage</a>. After closure, the bots were either destroyed, sent to another location, or placed in storage.</p>
