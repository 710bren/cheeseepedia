<b><i>4031 95th St, Store #34</b></i> was a <i>Showbiz Pizza Place</i> which opened on January 19, 1983 with a Rock-Afire Explosion, and closed on November 26, 2017 with the Studio C Beta, 16m.

This location is known for a video taken during this store's closure of their Chuck E. walkaround head being destroyed by an employee with a sledgehammer. This reveals what happens to a walkaround costume during a store's closure.

<h2>History</h2>
Oak Lawn opened its doors on January 19th, 1983 with the Rock-Afire Explosion show like every other Showbiz Pizza. It was originally a corporate-owned location. It also was originally opened next to a Venture (Which later became Kmart after it relocated from 4104 W. 95th St in 1998) and a PayLess ShoeSource. In either 1989 or 1990, Oak Lawn received the 1988 remodel removing the older SPP decor, adding newer decor, received a new exterior change, and updated the Billy Bob stage. In 1991 or 1992, Oak Lawn received a major remodel, adding checkers around the wall, added Blue and White Awnings, and added more decor and removed some older decor, and received Concept Unification removing the Rock-Afire Explosion for the 3-Stage. Oak Lawn received a minor remodel in the Mid-90's removing older CU decor for the Record Posters.

Around the late 90's, Oak Lawn would receive another remodel which removed all older 90's decor, added newer decor, and added SkyTubes; The Kmart opened next door in the former Venture building in 1998.

Around July of 2006, Oak Lawn received the 2005 Update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative removing older decor, removing the Showroom Walls, Balcony Seating, and also removing the 3-Stage for a Studio C Beta, 16m.

Oak Lawn remained like this until November 26th, 2017 when they closed because of fighting and being in a bad area. The Kmart and Payless ShoeSource also closed down. After closure, the location was abandoned until 2021 when it and Payless ShoeSource were converted into an Amazon Fresh Store. The Kmart was turned into DuPage Medical Group.

Currently, as of February 2023, the Amazon Fresh building & DuPage Medical Group are still there.
