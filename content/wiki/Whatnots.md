**Whatnots** are _Chuck E. Cheese_ extras introduced in the Rockstar Era, coming with a variety of blank humanoid puppet patterns, with accessories added to create any character for puppet showtapes. The set of puppets are similar to the _Muppet_ [https://muppet.fandom.com/wiki/Whatnots patterns], and [https://muppet.fandom.com/wiki/Anything_Muppets Anything Muppets] on _[https://muppet.fandom.com/wiki/Sesame_Street Sesame Street].

The first whatnot puppets were introduced in Speak Up, Stop Bullying, and other examples of showtapes with Whatnots include The Stranger Things parody, It's the 70s, and If Every Day Was Halloween.
