<h2> Trivia: </h2>

* 'Workin' for the Weekend' is originally from <a href="{{< ref "wiki/January 2006 Show" >}}">January 2006</a>, 'Need a New Wheel', 'Pizza Oven' and Hard Hat Hank are originally from <a href="{{< ref "wiki/April 2012 Show" >}}">April 2012</a>, 'Crocodile Rock' is originally from <a href="{{< ref "wiki/September 2005 Show" >}}">September 2005</a>, 'Sing a Song' is originally from <a href="{{< ref "wiki/January 2004 Show" >}}">January 2004</a>, 'Everybody Wants to Rule the World' is originally from <a href="{{< ref "wiki/January 2009 Show" >}}">January 2009</a>, 'Come On Let's Go' is originally from <a href="{{< ref "wiki/September 2011 Show" >}}">September 2011</a>, and 'Get Down On It' is originally from <a href="{{< ref "wiki/April 2007 Show" >}}">April 2007</a>. All of Chuck E.'s lines have been rerecorded by Jaret.
* The footage for 'Workin' for the Weekend', 'Crocodile Rock' and 'Everybody Wants to Rule the World' was redone to better fit the songs.
* The new footage for 'Working for the Weekend' and 'Everybody Wants to Rule the World' has the walkarounds for Chuck & Helen wearing outfits closer to their Rockstar designs despite still using the Avenger era heads. This would also be the last show to use the Avenger era walkaround in newly produced footage.
* 'Working for the Weekend', 'Crocodile Rock', 'Everybody Wants to Rule the World' and 'Get Down on It' all lack the beginning announcer's bits from the shows they originated from. Despite this, Bird's programming for these was left intact for all except 'Crocodile Rock'.
* 'Working for the Weekend' removes Chuck's spoken lines during the interlude. Despite this, his spotlight programming was left intact on Existing Stages. 
*The <a href="{{< ref "wiki/September 2011 Show" >}}">September 2011</a> logo is shown at the end of 'Sing a Song', replacing the 2004 logo.
* The music for all the cover songs were reworked to varying degrees, most notably the drums.
* This was the first show to feature versions of the live shows redubbed by Jaret. Birthday 2009 stills uses Duncan's voice, though the 'Little Bit of 80s' footage at the beginning has been changed to the 'We Got The Beat' footage from the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/May 2011 Show" >}}">May 2011 Show</a>.
* This show featured the final Super Jasper ever created. This was also the final time the 1999 Jasper puppet (or any of the 1999 puppets) would be seen in newly produced footage.
* This was the first show to use the automatic live show feature for Studio C and Weigl stores. With this feature, live shows will start automatically every hour. Five minute countdowns have also been added to all live shows. The automatic live for this show was Cupid Shuffle.
* The live show countdown marks the first appearance of the new Pasqually puppet.
* 'Need a New Wheel', 'Pizza Oven' and 'Get Down on It' all lack the applause SFX at the end.
*Hidden at the end of the Studio C DVD is the theme song for Bobby Bear which would later be used in the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/April 2013 Show" >}}">April 2013 Show</a>. The intermission was planned for this show but was not finished in time.
