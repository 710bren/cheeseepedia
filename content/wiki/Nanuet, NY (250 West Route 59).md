This store opened housing a [Studio C 2000]({{< ref "wiki/Studio C 2000.md" >}}) (Beta) with a 16 movement Garner Holt Productions Chuck E. Cheese Animatronic wearing the 'Cool Chuck' outfit this outfit would be partially replaced with the 'Avenger Chuck' shirt sometime in the late 2000's - Early 2010's (the hat also being replaced sometime in the early 2010's as well), the curtains became disabled in fall of 2011 and the TV's also got replaced with 3 LG TV's of the same size that they still have to this day. the 'Cool' shorts and rest of the 'Avenger' outfit would be replaced sometime around 2015-16, because of the exterior sign change. the bluescreen and camera were removed sometime in 2013 (replaced with a Ticket Blaster mural) along with the dim lighting, the 'STUDIO C' sign was moved to above the TV's following the removal of the Bluescreen + Camera.
