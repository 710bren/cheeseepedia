**_Choo Choo**_ is one of the prop characters in the [[Rock-afire Explosion]], having made his debut as an animatronic at [[Jacksonville, FL (9820 Atlantic Blvd)]].

##  History ## 

###  Origins & Showbiz Pizza Place ### 
Choo Choo was a direct copy of the character 'Choo Choo' from the [[Hard Luck Bears]]. He would move up and down to the songs, and sat in a log next to [[Dook Larue]]. He was only acknowledged once by the band in the [[Trivia Night]] showtape. During [[Concept Unification]], several Choo Choos would be retrofitted into [[Munch Jr.]]

###  Present Day ### 
Original parts for Choo Choo would start to be reproduced by Creative Engineering's new employees in 2023.
