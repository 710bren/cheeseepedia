<b><i>Choo Choo</b></i> is one of the prop characters in the [Rock-afire Explosion]({{< ref "wiki/Rock-afire Explosion.md" >}}), having made his debut as an animatronic at [Jacksonville, FL (9820 Atlantic Blvd)]({{< ref "wiki/Jacksonville, FL (9820 Atlantic Blvd).md" >}}).

<h2> History </h2>

<h2>= Origins & Showbiz Pizza Place </h2>=
Choo Choo was a direct copy of the character 'Choo Choo' from the [Hard Luck Bears]({{< ref "wiki/Hard Luck Bears.md" >}}). He would move up and down to the songs, and sat in a log next to [Dook Larue]({{< ref "wiki/Dook Larue.md" >}}). He was only acknowledged once by the band in the Trivia Night showtape. During [Concept Unification]({{< ref "wiki/Concept Unification.md" >}}), several Choo Choos would be retrofitted into Munch Jr.

<h2>= Present Day </h2>=
Original parts for Choo Choo would start to be reproduced by Creative Engineering's new employees in 2023.
