Choo Choo was a direct copy of the character 'Choo Choo' from the [Hard Luck Bears]({{< ref "wiki/Hard Luck Bears.md" >}}). He would move up and down to the songs, and sat in a log next to [Dook Larue]({{< ref "wiki/Dook Larue.md" >}}).

During [Concept Unification]({{< ref "wiki/Concept Unification.md" >}}){< ref "wiki/Concept Unification.md" >}}), several Choo Choos would be retrofitted into [Munch Jr.]({{< ref "wiki/Munch Jr.md" >}})
