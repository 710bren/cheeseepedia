San Pedro Sula, Honduras is a Chuck E. Cheese’s that opened on
July 3, 2018 with a [Circles of Light]({{< ref "wiki/Circles of Light.md" >}}) show with no animatronic. It is the second CEC to open in Honduras. The store is located in Multiplaza Mall.

Unfortunately, almost nothing is known about the location, other than the fact that it is about 15,435 square feet.<ref> https://www.laprensa.hn/honduras/abre-operaciones-chuck-e-cheeses-san-pedro-sula-CFlp1194262 </ref>
