**_SongCode**_ was an animatronic programming system made for Pizza Time Theatre, running from 1978 to 1990.

The first known usage would be at the second location [San Jose, CA (1371 Kooser Rd)]({{< ref "wiki/San Jose, CA (1371 Kooser Rd).md" >}}), with its hardware detailed in the SongCode Control System. 

It was used to animate the [Kooser PTT Show]({{< ref "wiki/Kooser PTT Show.md" >}}), [Cyberamics]({{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics.md" >}}), and later [Rock-afire Explosion]({{< ref "wiki/Rock-afire Explosion.md" >}}) showtapes throughout the late 80's. The [Animation Programming System]({{< ref "wiki/Animation Programming System.md" >}}) (APS) would replace it in 1990, staying as the main programming software till present day.

## Software ##
The software was written in the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11_architecture PDP-11 CISC Architecture] for the main PDP-11, and later PDP-11/23, that ran it. Due to the PDP-11 having 16-bit hardware, its engineers were able to expand the unit's memory with an external device to be 32k of onboard memory.

By 1978 most PDP-11 users created programs on Unix 6th Edition, which could mean SongCode was written in the C Language, though the possibility of the program being written in raw Assembly or other languages is still possible.

## Encoding Format ##
The format is believed to be an earlier variation of what would later appear in the [Studio C 3x DVD + Floppy]({{< ref "wiki/Studio C 3x DVD + Floppy.md" >}}) showtape format, being a command-based structure, rather than a snapshot based one.
