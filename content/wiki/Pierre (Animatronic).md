{{Animatronic|releasedate=1978|manufacturer=Creative Engineering|image=pierrebcj.jpg|unitsProduced=2}}Pierre LeBear was created for the [Bear Country Jubilee]({{< ref "wiki/Bear Country Jubilee.md" >}}) which was sold to Morey's Piers and Americana Amusement Park. His mech was later reused for Pete Thornsberry in the [Hard Luck Bears]({{< ref "wiki/Hard Luck Bears.md" >}}).

## History ##
Pierre along with the Bear Country Jubilee show was developed from 1977 - 1978. One show would be sold to Americana Amusement Park in Monroe, Ohio. The current whereabouts of the show is unknown. A 2nd show was sold to Morey's Piers in Wildwood, New Jersey. This show was sold back to CEI in 1984<ref><nowiki>https://youtu.be/0l6-6ewuY70?si=GX_FAUIVmPuayYyv&t=1545</nowiki></ref> and currently resides at the CEI museum.

## Design ##
In his design for Americana Amusement Park, he wore a a collar and black bowtie. At Morey's Piers, he wore a red, paisley bowtie and blue vest.

## Movements ##
Due to his mech being reused for the Hard Luck Bears, we have a better idea of his movements than the others. There still may be some differences however.
