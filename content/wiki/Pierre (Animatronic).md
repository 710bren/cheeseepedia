{{Animatronic|releasedate=1978|manufacturer=Creative Engineering|image=pierrebcj.jpg|unitsProduced=2}}Pierre LeBear was created for the [[Bear Country Jubilee]] which was sold to Morey's Piers and Americana Amusement Park. His mech was later reused for Pete Thornsberry in the [[Hard Luck Bears]].

##  History ## 
Pierre along with the Bear Country Jubilee show was developed from 1977 - 1978. One show would be sold to Americana Amusement Park in Monroe, Ohio. The current whereabouts of the show is unknown. A 2nd show was sold to Morey's Piers in Wildwood, New Jersey. This show was sold back to CEI in 1984<ref><nowiki>https://youtu.be/0l6-6ewuY70?si=GX_FAUIVmPuayYyv&t=1545</nowiki></ref> and currently resides at the CEI museum.

##  Design ## 
In his design for Americana Amusement Park, he wore a a collar and black bowtie. At Morey's Piers, he wore a red, paisley bowtie and blue vest.
