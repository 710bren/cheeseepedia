<h2> Cylinder Rebuilding </h2>
An official procedure for cylinder rebuilding is documented in the ShowBiz Pizza Place Operations Manual from 1981.<blockquote>
# Remove front or rear face of cylinder
# Remove piston
# Remove nose seal and 'O' rings
# Clean all parts with a clean rag and denatured alcohol
# Coat piston and new seals with packer lube
# Install the new 'O' rings (flanges facing each other)
# Coat the cylinder wall with parker 'O-ring' lube
# Lube piston rod with 10 weight non-detergent oil
# Reassemble NOTE: It is advisable to rebuild the cylinder on a clean piece of paper or newspaper. This will help prevent foreign matter finding its way inside your newly rebuilt cylinder.
