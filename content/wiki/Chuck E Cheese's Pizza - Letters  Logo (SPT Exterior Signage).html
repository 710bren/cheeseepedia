<h2> Usage </h2>
It's currently unknown which PTT used it, but it is speculated that it was first used in 1987, after that this sign would be used in various PTT stores, and some new stores which opened with the Chuck E.'s House (Rocker Stage) and used the CEC branding. After this Sign the Concept Unification Stage era began.

<h2> Variants </h2>
There would be a few variants of this signage used throughout its lifespan.

The SPP signage would often be seen accompanied by two smaller signs next to the main sign which read 'Family' and 'Fun' (formerly used by ShowBiz Pizza Place to say 'Pizza' and 'Place') There were also many unique variants used at some locations during its lifespan., for example some would only say 'Chuck. E. Cheese's', others would only use Letters like [Corona, CA (191 N McKinley St)]({{< ref "wiki/Corona, CA (191 N McKinley St).md" >}}).
