<p>On May 7, 1983, the location would sponsor the <i>12th Annual Angel Island Run</i> to help raise money for underprivileged children. Over 1,500 participants would run the 4.8-mile race along an island in San Francisco Bay. Multiple corporate members would attend the event:</p><ul><li>Marketing: Pat Saign, Don Schulte</li><li>Finance: Steve Merchant</li><li>Wardrobe: Tine Ahmann</li><li>Graphics: Karen Mitchell</li></ul>
<p>Don Schulte would run the race in a Chuck E. Cheese mascot costume, clocking in at 44 minutes, ahead of most other runners. Other costume characters would greet people on the island, whether in the race or not. A 30-foot inflatable Chuck E. Cheese was set up on a hill in the island, visible to passing sailboats.<sup>[4]</sup></p>
