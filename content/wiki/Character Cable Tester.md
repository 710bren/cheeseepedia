The **_Character Cable Tester**_ is a device made by _Creative Engineering_ to test the [Rock-afire Explosion Control System]({{< ref "wiki/Rock-afire Explosion Control System.md" >}}) continuity of each wire of a character cable from one connector to the other. This is a one-off device that was made for internal CEI use during cable manufacturing and testing.
