The <b><i>Homely for Christmas Cassette</b></i> was a home release for the SPP Homely for Christmas (SPP Homely For Christmas '87) showtape, releasing around December of 1987.

The tape contained the full showtape's tracks, with the first two segments on side one, and the last two segments on side two. Dave Thomas, a staple for making Creative Records' art for their labels, would produce his final piece for the tape, as this would be the final Creative Records release.
