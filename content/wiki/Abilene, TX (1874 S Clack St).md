## History ##
Abilene opened on October 7, 1982 with a Rock-afire Explosion [Classic Stage]({{< ref "wiki/Classic Stage.md" >}}). Sadly, very little information on Abilene's Showbiz Pizza is extremely hard to find, so no videos or photos have resurfaced as of today. In Late 1983 (month and day unknown, likely November), the location closed after a little over a year of operation. The building remains vacant today or has been taken up by a business. One notable thing about the location is that their stage was sent to the soon to be opened [Whitehall, PA (1000 Lehigh Valley Mall)]({{< ref "wiki/Whitehall, PA (1000 Lehigh Valley Mall).md" >}}){< ref "wiki/Whitehall, PA (1000 Lehigh Valley Mall).md" >}}){< ref "wiki/Whitehall, PA (1000 Lehigh Valley Mall).md" >}}){< ref "wiki/Whitehall, PA (1000 Lehigh Valley Mall).md" >}}){< ref "wiki/Whitehall, PA (1000 Lehigh Valley Mall).md" >}}){< ref "wiki/Whitehall, PA (1000 Lehigh Valley Mall).md" >}}) store, which would have their opening in December. As of July 2023, that store still operates under the CEC banner.
