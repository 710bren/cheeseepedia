**_2369 McArthur Ave**_ is a _Showbiz Pizza/Chuck E. Cheese_ that opened on April 22, 1982 as a corporate _ShowBiz Pizza Place_ with a [https://chuckepedia.com/wiki/Classic_Stage Rock-Afire Explosion]. It is located in the Town and Country Shopping Center.
## History## 
Springfield opened its doors on April 22nd, 1982 with a Rock-afire Explosion show. It was originally and currently a corporate-owned store. Like many other ShowBiz Pizza locations, it had a typical SPP layout seen in many other stores across the United States and would eventually receive the 1988 remodel years after it would open. Although some little documentation exists back in the ShowBiz days, it can be determined that Springfield was one of several locations to receive an Uncle Klunk show package (and a Santa Claus retrofit package as well) sometime after opening. Like many ShowBiz locations in the late 1980s, Springfield received the Showbiz Pizza Campground upgrade.

In around 1990, Springfield received Concept Unification which converted the show to Munch's Make Believe Band. In around the Mid-Late 1990's, Springfield received either [https://chuckepedia.com/wiki/Phase_1_(1994) Phase 1] or [https://chuckepedia.com/wiki/Phase_2_(1997) Phase 2] remodel which removed some early 90's decor and added new decor and SkyTubes. Springfield remained this way until sometime in 2008-2009 when they received the 2005 Remodel which involved removing the Showroom Walls, balcony Seating, received a new exterior, and also removing some older 90's decor. In 2011, they received the CU 1-Stage along with [[Whitehall, PA (1000 Lehigh Valley Mall)]], and [[Columbus, GA (3201 Macon Rd)]]. As of January 2023, they still have the CU 1-Stage.
