<p><b><i>10430 Midlothian Turnpike, Store #652</b></i> is a Chuck E. Cheese restaurant that opened as a Showbiz Pizza on May 1, 1990, with a Rock-Afire Explosion, which is still open to this day.</p>
<p>This location is notable for being the last Showbiz Pizza location to open, as Concept Unification would be happening around this time, this location would very shortly after convert to a 3-Stage in Fall 1992, which was removed in January 2023. Richmond was the 10th last 3-Stage.</p>
<p><h2> History </h2></p>
<p><h3> Showbiz Pizza Place 1990-Fall 1992 </h3></p>
<p>The location would open on May 1, 1990, as the very last Showbiz Pizza Place location with a Rock-afire Explosion show. This location would end up receiving Concept Unification around August to September of 1992.</p>
<p><h3> Chuck E. Cheese's Fall 1992-Present </h3></p>
<p>The location would become a Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza location around August to September 1992. It is currently unknown when exactly this location received the Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 remodels, however the store would receive the 2005 Avenger redesign between 2005-2006.  The location would receive 2.0 in January 2023.</p>
<p><h2> Stages </h2></p>
<p>Originally, the store had a Rock-Afire Explosion, the location the stage came from was Surfside Beach, South Carolina, in which that came from <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Park Ridge, IL (678 N Northwest Hwy)" >}}">Park Ridge, Illinois</a>. They would have the stage for a short time, until 1992, when they would undergo Concept Unification, turning the RAE into Munch's Make-Believe Band. Their 3-Stage had the MMBB logo from the Road and 2-Stages. In 2017, their Pizzacam was repaired by Connor L who replaced the cosmetics with new ones but was removed after the Tolomatic was considered unrepairable with the cosmetics being returned as of a result. In January 2023, the 3-Stage was removed as part of their 2.0 remodel. It was formerly the last 3-Stage in the state of Virginia, after Roanoke received 2.0 in July 2022.</p>
