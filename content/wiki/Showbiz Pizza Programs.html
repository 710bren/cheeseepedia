<p><b><i>Showbiz Pizza Program</b></i> was a music cassette collection released alongside Showbiz Pizza Place and Pizza Time Theatre showtapes as background music between segments.</p>
<p>Similar to <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Family Vision" >}}">Family Vision</a>, these would be a precursor to Cyberstar, and would be released until its full integration into Showbiz Pizza Place locations, despite Pizza Time Theatre locations continuing to use reels for another year.</p>
<p><h2> History </h2></p>
<p>These programs were still produced by <i>Sight & Sound Entertainment Corporation</i>, however the company would be merged into <i>Audio Environments Inc.,</i> rebranding as <i>AEI Music</i>. Under AEI, the company would become specialized in creating music tape compilations for retail stores and airlines. This provided a specific mood tailored to the store, in which AEI describes to '-harmonize with the lifestyle of (the store's) patrons'<sup>[1]</sup> The Showbiz Pizza Programs were specifically labeled as <i>Inflight Audio Entertainment</i>, and each gave the address of AEI Music Network Inc. at the bottom of the label.</p>
<p>It is currently known that Program 11 came with the Summertime shows for 1988, and that Program 15 came with the Christmas shows for 1988. Releases 11-18 line up correctly, with 18 being exactly alongside the last known Showbiz reel to be produced, though it isn't clear which releases matched up with 1-10.</p>
<p>It isn't clear what procedure was done for CEC tapes after the release of Program 18, as they would continue to use reels up to <a href="{{< ref "wiki/CEC September 1990 Show" >}}">CEC September 1990 Show</a>.</p>
<p><h2>CEC Dance - Grammy</h2></p>
<p>Oddly, the CEC showtape release for October 1988 is absent, which would have synched up with <a href="{{< ref "wiki/SPP Dance - Grammy" >}}">SPP Dance - Grammy</a>. As of current knowledge, the September show continued on until the Christmas show later that year. The release of its SPP counterpart, alongside <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Showbiz Pizza Program 14" >}}">Showbiz Pizza Program 14</a> which would have came with it being produced, it is unknown if there may have been a CEC Dance - Grammy type showtape in this slot that we aren't aware of yet.</p>
