##History##
Escondido opened its doors on August 1st, 1983 as the 11th Showbiz Pizza store in store in California. It opened with the Rock-Afire Explosion and was located right next to Kmart which originally opened on May 2nd, 1968. Escondido received bits of the 1988 Remodel in 1988-1989 where some SPP decor was removed for newer decor though some remained, and the Billy Bob stage was changed. In 1991, Escondido received Concept Unification and fully received the 1988 remodel removing all SPP decor for CU decor, added Blue and White awnings above the salad bar, added checkers around and outside the store, and removed the Rock-Afire Explosion for the 3-Stage. The store would receive the 1993 remodel sometime by the Mid 90's removing older CU decor for Record Posters, and removing the Blue and White awnings above the salad bar. In the Late 90's, Escondido received another remodel, changing the exterior, removed older decor for newer decor, and replaced the ball pit with SkyTubes. It was then featured on America's Funniest Home Videos in 2004. Escondido would remain like this until March 2006 when they would close down due to being near an abandoned Kmart which closed on April 13th, 2003, 3 yeaars before closure. After closure, the store was abandoned for a few weeks and it and Kmart were immediately destroyed to make way for the Lowe's to be built on top of it. Currently, as of March 2023, the Lowe's is still there.
##Stages##
Originally when the store opened, they had a Rock-Afire Explosion. In around 1991, they would undergo Concept Unification, this was the process used to convert the RAE characters into the Chuck E. Cheese characters. It would remain until the store closed.
