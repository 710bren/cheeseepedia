The Winchester Jasper Bot was created by Harold Goldbrandsen of Fantasy Forest in early 1977 after the [[Winchester Crusty the Cat V1 (Animatronic)|V1 Crusty]] & [[Winchester Chuck E. Cheese V1 (Animatronic)|Chuck]].

<h2>= Release </h2>=

<h2>== San Jose, California (370 South Winchester Boulevard) </h2>==

The bot was later programmed to the [Madame Oink I]({{< ref "wiki/Madame Oink I.html" >}}) & [Foxy Colleen I]({{< ref "wiki/Foxy Colleen I.html" >}}) Showtapes during 1978.

<h2>== Corporate Move </h2>==
After Pizza Time Theatre vacated the Sunnyvale building in 1984, Jasper, along with Winchester's [[Winchester Chuck E. Cheese V2 (Animatronic)|Chuck E. Cheese (V2) Bot]] and [[Winchester Pasqually (Animatronic)|Pasqually Bot]] would be rescued by Jul Kamen. Jul would end up loaning all three portrait bots to the [[Showbiz Pizza Time Corporate Office|SPT Headquarters]] in the mid 1990's to display in a museum dedicated to the history of Chuck E. Cheese's. The museum plans would never go through and the animatronics would simply be used as display pieces.

At some point, Jasper's shirt was replaced with a blue and white striped shirt and their muzzle was repainted with extra spots.

In 2004, Corporate would undergo a remodel and the portrait bots would be removed from their spot on the wall.

The person who destroyed them is unknown.
