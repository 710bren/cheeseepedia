<p><h2> History </h2></p>
<p><h3> Creation </h3></p>
<p>The Winchester Jasper Bot was created by Harold Goldbrandsen of Fantasy Forest in early 1977 after the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Winchester Crusty the Cat V1 (Animatronic)" >}}">V1 Crusty</a> & <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Winchester Chuck E Cheese V1 (Animatronic)" >}}">Chuck</a>.</p>
<p><h3> Release </h3></p>
<p><h4> San Jose, California (370 South Winchester Boulevard) </h4></p>
<p>In May 1977, The Bot was installed at the Right dining area wall at Winchester<sup>[1]</sup><sup>[2]</sup>. The bot was programmed to the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Pizza Time Theatre Showtape" >}}">Pizza Time Theatre Showtape</a> & later, the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Helen Henny Showtape" >}}">Helen Henny Showtape</a>. The bot was later programmed to the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Madame Oink I" >}}">Madame Oink I</a> & <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Foxy Colleen I" >}}">Foxy Colleen I</a> Showtapes during 1978.</p>
<p><h4> Corporate Move </h4></p>
<p>After Pizza Time Theatre vacated the Sunnyvale building in 1984, Jasper, along with Winchester's <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Winchester Chuck E Cheese V2 (Animatronic)" >}}">Chuck E. Cheese (V2) Bot</a> and <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Winchester Pasqually (Animatronic)" >}}">Pasqually Bot</a> would be rescued by Jul Kamen. Jul would end up loaning all three portrait bots to the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Showbiz Pizza Time Corporate Office" >}}">SPT Headquarters</a> in the mid 1990's to display in a museum dedicated to the history of Chuck E. Cheese's. The museum plans would never go through and the animatronics would simply be used as display pieces.</p>
<p>At some point, Jasper's shirt was replaced with a blue and white striped shirt and their muzzle was repainted with extra spots.</p>
<p><h3> Destruction </h3></p>
<p>In 2004, Corporate would undergo a remodel and the portrait bots would be removed from their spot on the wall.
