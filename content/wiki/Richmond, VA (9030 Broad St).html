<b><i>9030 Broad St</b></i>, also known as <b><i>Henrico</b></i>, is a <i>Chuck E. Cheese's</i> that opened on March 4, 1999, and is still open today with a [Studio C Alpha]({{< ref "wiki/Studio C Alpha.md" >}}). 

This is not to be confused with [Richmond, VA (10430 Midlothian Turnpike)]({{< ref "wiki/Richmond, VA (10430 Midlothian Turnpike).md" >}}), which opened on May 1, 1990, and is still open today with the 2.0 remodel, and is in the city limits of <b><i>Bon Air</b></i>.

<h2> Stage </h2>
Henrico opened with a [Studio C Alpha]({{< ref "wiki/Studio C Alpha.md" >}}). The curtains were disabled years later, and Chuck E.'s cap was later removed in 2013.
In September of 2023 the store received the 2.0 remodel which removed the Studio C Alpha stage for the 2021 model of the Dance Floor and Video Wall. As of October 2023, the store is still open with the 2.0 remodel.

<h2> History </h2>
Henrico opened on March 4, 1999, with a [Studio C Alpha]({{< ref "wiki/Studio C Alpha.md" >}}) and the [Phase II]({{< ref "wiki/Phase 2 (1997).md" >}}) remodel. Barely any information on Henrico exists at this time.

In 2008/2009, Henrico received the 2005 update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative, which involved removing all 90s decor, showroom walls, balcony seating, added purple walls, and changed the exterior. In September 2023 the store received 2.0 removing all older decor and replacing it with modern decor. As of October 2023, the store remains open with the 2.0 remodel.
