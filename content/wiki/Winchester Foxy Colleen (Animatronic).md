<b><i>Winchester Foxy Colleen</b></i> was an animatronic produced by [Fantasy Forest]({{< ref "wiki/Fantasy Forest.md" >}}) in October 1978 for the [Pizza Time Theatre]({{< ref "wiki/Pizza Time Theatre.md" >}}) on [San Jose, CA (370 S Winchester Blvd)]({{< ref "wiki/San Jose, CA (370 S Winchester Blvd).md" >}}) as the third PTT guest star, Foxy Colleen. The bot was used until 1981, when Winchester received [Cyberamics]({{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics.md" >}}).

<h2>History</h2>
The Bot was installed in October of 1978 replacing [Winchester Madam Oink]({{< ref "wiki/Winchester Madam Oink (Animatronic).md" >}}) for the [Foxy Colleen I]({{< ref "wiki/Foxy Colleen I.md" >}}) Showtape. They were the final Fantasy Forest Guest Star to be installed at Winchester, & the last Fantasy Forest bot installed at Winchester in general. The Bot was put in the 'The Great All-American pizza Show' Brochure in 1979<ref>https://showbizpizza.com/info/promo/ptt/ptt_79franchise.pdf</ref>. As with other Winchester bots, her whereabouts after 1980 are unknown but she was most likely sent to [Sunnyvale]({{< ref "wiki/Pizza Time Theatre Sunnyvale, CA Corporate Office.md" >}}) after being uninstalled. After the bankruptcy in 1983 Foxy Colleen was presumably destroyed.

<h2>Design</h2>
She had long brown hair, a small green top hat with a black stripe and white 3 leaved clovers surrounding the stripe, light brown eyes, a white shirt, white necklaces around her left wrist similar to Winchester Madam Oink's, a green skirt with another 3 leaved clover on the front of it, a felt clover sticking out of her skirt, and a microphone mounted to her base like Winchester Chuck E. Cheese V2 (Animatronic) (V2 Winchester Chuck) and [Winchester Madam Oink]({{< ref "wiki/Winchester Madam Oink (Animatronic).md" >}}).

<h2>Movements</h2>
It's unknown what movements The Bot had at this time, but we do know they had a Eye movement, Mouth Movement, & Left Arm Raise.
