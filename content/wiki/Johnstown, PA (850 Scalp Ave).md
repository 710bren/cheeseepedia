<b><i>Johnstown, PA (850 Scalp Ave)</b></i> was <b>'Showplace Pizza</b>'. It opened in 1989<ref>:Category:Licensed Family Entertainment Center Store List</ref>, after the Showbiz Pizza located at <b><i>[Johnstown, PA (1523 Scalp Ave)]({{< ref "wiki/Johnstown, PA (1523 Scalp Ave).md" >}})</b></i> had a fire. This location most likely opened due to a refusal to undergo Concept Unificiation. It hosed a Rock-Afire-Explosion show and the animatronics presumably came from the previous location. It also had most of the same arcade games and rides a regular Showbiz would have. Showplace Pizza would eventually close in 1994, bringing the end of the RAE and Showbiz in Johnstown. A Chuck E. Cheese's would eventually open in 2003 on [Galleria Dr.]({{< ref "wiki/Johnstown,PA (592 Galleria Dr).md" >}}) and would close in June of 2020. 

The RAE Animatronics origins are unknown but most likely come from the previous Showbiz location, and their current status is unknown.
