<p><b><i>10535 S. State St, Store #3203</b></i> was a franchised <i>Chuck E. Cheese's</i> location that opened in Summer of 1996 with a 1-Stage and closed in 2014.</p>
<p>This location is <b>not</b> a relocation of, or to be confused with the Sandy, UT (792 E 9400) which was a Pizza Time Theatre location that opened in February 1983 and closed in April 1985.</p>
<p><h2>Stage</h2></p>
<p>This location received the Cyberamic characters from the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Riverside, CA (4033 Chicago Ave)" >}}">Riverside, CA</a> location for use on their 1-Stage show. Chuck later got Cool Chuck in the 2000s, keeping the derby, and by 2011, was replaced with Avenger. The Cyberamics still utilized a portion of the original cosmetics before removal, and featured the last PTT Chuck snout in a store, along with one of the last PTT Pasqually masks in a store. Jasper originally featured the late 80s' straw hat, but was eventually replaced with the standard cowboy hat in the mid 2000s.</p>
<p>Once the store closed in 2014, the stage was cleared of everything, and a large projector screen was put on the stage. The Cyberamics would then be sent to the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Orem, UT (40 E Center St)" >}}">Orem</a> store for parts on their 3-Stage show.</p>

<p><h2>History</h2></p>
<p>As this franchised store opened in 1996 in a secluded location, it has gone mostly undocumented besides of things seen in the 2001 home video that would suggest the store opened with <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Phase 1 (1994)" >}}">Phase I</a>.<sup>[1]</sup> At some point the store also received <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Phase 3 (2000)" >}}">Phase III</a>, which most likely is why the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Skytubes" >}}">Skytubes</a> were relocated between then and 2011.</p>
<p>In September 2011 this location was remodeled for the first time as a Chuck E. Cheese's during the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/CEC 2005 Remodel Program" >}}">CEC 2005 Remodel Program</a>. A percentage of the old art would remain, however, including the showroom shelves and walls.</p>
<p><h3> Closure </h3></p>
<p>By the Fall of 2014, the location closed and was turned into an expansion of the next-door All-Star Bowling franchise. All of the walls were repainted, and all CEC branding would be removed, although various games would be reused,<sup>[2]</sup> most notably the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Skytubes" >}}">Skytubes</a>. The Showroom, however, remained, along with the stage (without the bots or props) the artifact shelves, the booths, and the hanging lights.</p>
