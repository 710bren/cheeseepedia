The articulated Chuck E. walkaround head was created in 1996 by a former CEI employee, Billy Bob Irving. This head was used in three different showtapes, those being:

* [August 1996]({{< ref "wiki/August 1996.md" >}})
* [April 1997]({{< ref "wiki/April 1997.md" >}})
* [August 1997]({{< ref "wiki/August 1997.md" >}}) 

During these showtapes, the head was often seen paired with various different outfits, such as the standard AAM outfit, the tuxedo, the yellow sweater, etc.

The head was also used in at least one live show training tape, that being the Get Ready training tape from 1997.<ref> https://youtu.be/_U_KTZy62ZI</ref> It has been assumed it was also in training tapes for other live shows such as Strike It Up.

In addition, the head was used in the notorious CEC movie, _Chuck E. Cheese In The Galaxy 5000_.<ref> https://youtu.be/LvPDKzSaeyg</ref> During the movie, the head is seen paired with a custom Coach Chuck outfit and later on a Racer outfit.

The head was destroyed by corporate between the 2000s-2015.
