**_CEC September 1991 Show**_ is a showtape released in 1991 for the 3-Stage and Cyberamics.

The show is known to have a lost song on it, which was removed sometime before its final release.

## Production ##

### Original Names ###
The original name for the showtape was called **_Family Times**_, as denoted on the APS floppy disk and its label. Segment 1's file data has this name, and is dated July 23, 1991. Segment 2 shortens this to just 'Family' by July 31st. Segment 3 and the later case label confirm this change.

On the release versions of the APS disks, the labels again change to 'September 1991', noting they both replace the original 'Family' and 'Family Times' disk. This removal of the shortened name to just the release month happened between August 26th - September 10th.

### Scrapped Segment ###
A show called ****cmds./clean**** (Likely **_Comrade of Clean**_ from a direct lyric) was scrapped from the show late into production, being already fully programmed for the 3-Stage before being scrapped. It is unknown if footage was shot and edited for the segment.

The show was specifically requested removal from upper management at CEC Corporate. This is likely due to the Soviet undertones of the song, as the Soviet Union was already beginning to collapse by the release of the tape.

Prior to the song being removed, the segments (excluding intermissions for clarity) were:<blockquote>
# **Segment 1**
## Responsibility
## My Good Name
# **Segment 2**
## Comrade of Clean
## Happy and You Know It
## This Old Man
# **Segment 3**
## Kid's Song Medley
### Skip To My Lou
### Little Liza Jane
### She'll Be Coming Around The Mountain
### Oh Them Golden Slippers
### Jimmy Crack Corn And I Don't Care
## Daddy's Daddy
</blockquote>The song itself was 2 minutes and 31 seconds long. The entire segment was _Comrade of Clean + Happy and You Know It + This Old Man_ back to back, making the full length 5 minutes and 6 seconds. After Comrade of Clean's removal, _Responsibility_ from segment 1 would replace it, and in its own place would be _Rhythm of the Night_ from the previous year's [CEC September 1990 Show]({{< ref "wiki/CEC September 1990 Show.md" >}}).

The [signals]({{< ref "wiki/Data.md" >}}) for the show would be discovered in 2022 on the [1990-1992 APS Floppy Cases]({{< ref "wiki/1990-1992 APS Floppy Cases.md" >}}) and presented without audio on July 21, 2022<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgsROB6xwb4</ref>. The audio for the segment would be discovered in mid-2023, and released on December 24th, 2023.<ref>https://youtu.be/YIwEWOMB2LI</ref> The first unveiling of the combined signals and audio would air a few minutes later.<ref>https://youtu.be/ZbSCCVqTd0A</ref>
