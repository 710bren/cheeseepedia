<p><b><i>678 Northwest Highway</b></i> was a ShowBiz Pizza Place that opened on December 29th, 1982 and closed in early 1985.</p>
<p><h2> History </h2></p>
<p>Park Ridge, like all other ShowBiz locations, opened with The Rock-afire Explosion. There is not to much information about this store, other than a newspaper article and the interior of the store being shown in a 1987 Christian movie.</p>
<p><h3>Movie</h3></p>
<p>Park Ridge’s interior and Rock-afire Explosion show are shown in the 1987 Christian movie, <i>Gold Through The Fire</i>.<sup>[1]</sup>The ShowBiz part of the movie would’ve had to have been filmed during or before 1985, as Park Ridge closed in 1985.</p>
<p>The exterior shown in the film is not Park Ridge’s exterior, but rather <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Arlington Heights, IL (955 W Dundee Rd)" >}}">Arlington Heights, IL’s exterior.</a></p>
<p><h3>Post Closure</h3></p>
<p>After this location closed, their Rock-afire Explosion show and several of the stores entertainment assets were saved and stored by Showbiz Corporate. Then, in Spring 1985, the Surfside Beach, SC (900 US-17 BUS) store opened, and the assets were recycled from Park Ridge and used in this new store, including their Rock-afire Explosion show. The store then closed on September 21st 1989 after four years of operation and the show and assets were sent to the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Richmond, VA (10430 Midlothian Turnpike)" >}}">Richmond, VA (10430 Midlothian Turnpike)</a> store which opened May 1st 1990. Less than 2 years later, it underwent Concept Unification and was converted into Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza. That store is still open to this day under the Chuck E. Cheese's banner.</p>
