<h2> Trivia </h2>

* 'Stay Positive' is originally from Chuck E. Cheese's Show 2 2021 (Show 2 2021). “Together We’ve Got It” is originally from Chuck E. Cheese's Show 1 2017 (Show 1 2017), “My Family” is originally from Chuck E. Cheese's Show 3 2019 (Show 3 2019), 'It's the 70s' is originally from Chuck E. Cheese's Show 5 2017 (Show 5 2017), 'Game On!' is originally from Chuck E. Cheese's Show 1 2020 (Show 1 2020), and 'Billy & The Bully' is originally from Chuck E. Cheese's Show 7 2016 (Show 7 2016).
* 'Billy & The Bully' normally has a unique title card saying <b>Chuck E. Cheese's Presents</b> which was seen when it used with Chuck E. Cheese's Show 7 2016 (Show 7 2016) and Chuck E. Cheese's Show 6 2017 (Show 6 2017). For this current release it was removed.
*This was the first show not to include Birthday Live at Home following its introduction in Chuck E. Cheese's Show 2 2020 (Show 2 2020). With the reintroduction of the Chuck E. Cheese walk-around in June 2021 after COVID-19 policies were loosened, stores began playing the recently reissued Birthday Star Spectacular again and the walk-around-less show became redundant.
