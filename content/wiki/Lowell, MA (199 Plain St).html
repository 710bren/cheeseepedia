<b><i> Lowell, MA (199 Plain St), Store #457</b></i>, is a <i>Chuck E. Cheese</i> location that opened on May 27th, 1993, and is still around today with the [CEC 2018 2.0 Remodel Program]({{< ref "wiki/CEC 2018 20 Remodel Program.html" >}}). It is located in the Meadow Brook Center.

This store opened on the same day as [Miami, FL (20335 Biscayne Blvd)]({{< ref "wiki/Miami, FL (20335 Biscayne Blvd).html" >}}).

<h2> History </h2>
Lowell opened May 27th, 1993, in Meadow Brook Center, with a [1-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/1-Stage.html" >}}). Kinetix Group Inc. produced the Show. All 5 opening day masks were from [[Showbiz Pizza Time Corporate Office|Corporate's]] Road Stage, designed by Jul Kamen. 

Lowell would be the first 1-Stage to have a blank brick wall for Pasqually, as the other early 1-Stages would feature the 'Pasqually's Amateur Hour' Art. Lowell also features minor differences in the cityscape backdrops that were changed for later versions, such as the edges of the far corners of the buildings being all green instead of the standard red that most 1-Stages would receive. 

In 2001, Pasqually would receive a new mask. In 2002, Lowell would replace their Side Curtains with Lift Curtains. In the early 2000s, Helen received a new mask. Munch's hat would also be removed as early as 2001. Chuck got the Cool Chuck outfit in 2002. 

Helen later got her third new mask and Chuck got the Avenger cap. Chuck's mask was replaced in January 2012. In May 2012, Lowell removed their Lift Curtains. 

In August 2012, Lowell would receive the 2005 Remodel, also known as the [CEC 2005 Remodel Program]({{< ref "wiki/CEC 2005 Remodel Program.html" >}}), and expand, rebuilding the stage in the process. This also included a major exterior remodel as well. The address would also be changed from 209 Plain St to 199 Plain St. Chuck's khakis went missing for a period at this time, before being placed back on. The Avenger cap was removed in September 2013.  

In 2017, Jasper and Pasqually would receive new masks, and Chuck got a new snout and jaw. In April 2018, Lowell would receive stage parts from Newington, New Hampshire, including Helen and Munch's masks, Munch's keyboard front, Pasqually's drum set, and Pasqually's shoes, which would be placed on Jasper.

In October 2021, Lowell's original Chuck, Helen, and Jasper top halves would be removed, and replaced with [[Worcester, MA (50 Southwest Cutoff)|Worcester's]] top halves. This would mark the final major change to the stage, as the stage would be removed along with [North Dartmouth, MA (412-418 State Rd)]({{< ref "wiki/North Dartmouth, MA (412-418 State Rd).html" >}}) in September 2023, marking the end of any MMBB stages existing in New England.

On November 1, 2023, the store held its Grand Reopening.

On April 24, 2024, the store would receive the trampolines. Then on April 25, 2024, the trampolines were fully setup.
