**_Middle of the Road**_ is a never before seen _Rock-afire Explosion_ showtape released sometime in or before 1987.

The tape was most likely created for _Showbiz Pizza Place_, and not other Family Entertainment Centers, as evidence of a copy coming from a Showbiz has been seen.

##  Confirmation of Existence ## 
Three current copies of the tape are known to exist. The first two copies are in a private collector's hands, the third copy is in another collector's hands, but was taken from _Billy Bob's Wonder Land_ amongst its other Showbiz tapes. One was seen in the 1987 Creative Engineering promo brochure amongst other tapes.
