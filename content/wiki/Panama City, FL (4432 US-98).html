<b><i>Panama City, FL (4432 US-98)</b></i> was a Showbiz Pizza Place/Chuck E. Cheese that opened on May 7, 1986, and closed in Spring 2007.
<h2>Stages</h2>
When this store first opened, it featured a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Classic Stage" >}}">Rock-afire Explosion</a> stage, as all Showbiz locations did. The stage would undergo Concept Unification in June 1991. Not much information is known about its stage, but the condition of it had reportedly deteriorated by 2006 and would not be repaired by the location's closure the following year. It is notable that this location kept its Munch Jr. animatronic throughout its entire lifespan.

<h2>History</h2>
In June 1985, a restaurant called the Frontier Club that sat on the site closed, and the property was sold to Dr. Palep Rao, a local gastroenterologist and Showbiz franchisee, who also owned the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Tallahassee, FL (2810 Sharer Rd)" >}}">Tallahassee</a> store. The restaurant, modeled after an Amish barn, was subsequently razed.
Construction of the store began in late 1985, concluding in February 1986, and the first ads for the location were printed in April 1986, teasing a May opening. It held its grand opening as a Showbiz Pizza Place on May 7, 1986 as the last Showbiz Pizza Place to open in Florida, and featured the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Classic Stage" >}}">Rock-afire Explosion</a> stage.
Between June 21 and 28, 1991, this store underwent <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Concept Unification" >}}">Concept Unification</a> and was billed as a Showbiz Pizza Place until February 1992. In 1993, the exterior signs were updated to the then-current Chuck E. Cheese logo, which would be displayed until its closure.
Not much information is known about this location, but it is believed that it had around 20 games in the arcade room (60 were advertised when it originally opened), and was at least 8,500 square feet.
In April 2006, the store would add a roof to the front entrance. This would be the last remodel that this location received to its exterior, as by May 2007 it would close down for unknown reasons, and would sit abandoned for a few months.
In December 2007, Dr. Rao sold the property to a hospitality group, who began demolition of the store in January 2008. Construction on the hotel that sits on the site began in April 2008 and concluded in 2009.
