Due to evidence that [Chicago, IL (5030 S Kedzie Ave)]({{< ref "wiki/Chicago, IL (5030 S Kedzie Ave).md" >}}) installed their sign mech for [Country Klunk]({{< ref "wiki/Country Klunk.md" >}}) in 1985, a store that wasn't open until November 1, 1984, stores that have sign mechs installed do not confirm whether they had received Klunk in 1983, or at a later time. These stores are currently unconfirmed due to this:

* [Dallas, TX (7110 S Westmoreland Rd)]({{< ref "wiki/Dallas, TX (7110 S Westmoreland Rd).md" >}})
* [Houston, TX (5535 Weslayan St)]({{< ref "wiki/Houston, TX (5535 Weslayan St).md" >}})

Two stores had some sort of Klunk part discovered at their location. Springfield with Klunk valves, and Davenport with a Klunk arm. This confirms Klunk was present at their store at some point, but it is unknown which event(s) he was used in. Davenport does mention potentially receiving a Klunk for 1983 however.<ref name=':0'>https://www.newspapers.com/image/665684553/?clipping_id=55395460&fcfToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJmcmVlLXZpZXctaWQiOjY2NTY4NDU1MywiaWF0IjoxNjk2OTcwNDk0LCJleHAiOjE2OTcwNTY4OTR9.sClG1OZrf2KnRIxRDXP7BAdtVpv1p4YKdgIgIRQHA4Q</ref>
