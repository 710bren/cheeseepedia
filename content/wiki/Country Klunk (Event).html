<h3>Unconfirmed Stores</h3>
Due to evidence that <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Chicago, IL (5030 S Kedzie Ave)" >}}">Chicago, IL (5030 S Kedzie Ave)</a> installed their sign mech for <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Country Klunk" >}}">Country Klunk</a> in 1985, a store that wasn't open until November 1, 1984, stores that have sign mechs installed do not confirm whether they had received Klunk in 1983, or at a later time. These stores are currently unconfirmed due to this:<ul><li><a href="{{< ref "wiki/Dallas, TX (7110 S Westmoreland Rd)" >}}">Dallas, TX (7110 S Westmoreland Rd)</a></li><li><a href="{{< ref "wiki/Houston, TX (5535 Weslayan St)" >}}">Houston, TX (5535 Weslayan St)</a></li></ul>
Two stores had some sort of Klunk part discovered at their location. Springfield with Klunk valves, and Davenport with a Klunk arm. This confirms Klunk was present at their store at some point, but it is unknown which event(s) he was used in. Davenport does mention potentially receiving a Klunk for 1983 however.<ref name=':0'>https://www.newspapers.com/image/665684553/?clipping_id=55395460&fcfToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJmcmVlLXZpZXctaWQiOjY2NTY4NDU1MywiaWF0IjoxNjk2OTcwNDk0LCJleHAiOjE2OTcwNTY4OTR9.sClG1OZrf2KnRIxRDXP7BAdtVpv1p4YKdgIgIRQHA4Q</ref><ul><li><a href="{{< ref "wiki/Springfield, OH (2345 Valley Loop Rd)" >}}">Springfield, OH (2345 Valley Loop Rd)</a><sup><a href="3">3</a></sup></li><li><a href="{{< ref "wiki/Davenport, IA (903 E Kimberly Rd)" >}}">Davenport, IA (903 E Kimberly Rd)</a><sup><a href="4">4</a></sup><ref name=':0' /></li></ul>
