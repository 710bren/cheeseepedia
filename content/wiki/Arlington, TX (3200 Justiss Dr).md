{{Generic|image=Arlington, TX Justiss.jpg|desc=()}}**_3200 Justiss Dr**_ also known as **_Justiss**_ was a Showbiz Pizza Place that opened on July 21, 1982 with a Rock-Afire Explosion, and closed in Summer 2001 with a 3-Stage.

##History##
8109 E Washington St opened on July 21st, 1982 and had a Rock-Afire Explosion like every other Showbiz. Around 1989 or 1990, they would receive Concept Unification and receive the Concept Unification decor and a new exterior. In around the Mid 1990's, They would receive either [Phase 1]({{< ref "wiki/Phase 1 (1994).md" >}}) or [Phase 2]({{< ref "wiki/Phase 2 (1997).md" >}}) which added a lot of 1990s decor and assets such as the Record Posters and Colored Chase Lights.  In the late 90's, they received the Phase 3 remodel which got a new exterior and most of the early 90s decor was removed and the late 90's and 2000's decor and SkyTubes were added. They would remain like this until their closure in Summer 2001.
##Stages##
Originally when the store opened, they had a Rock-Afire Explosion like every other Showbiz location. In 1989 or 100-, they would undergo Concept Unification, this was the process used to convert the RAE characters into the Chuck E. Cheese characters. They would still have this stage until their closure in Summer 2001.
