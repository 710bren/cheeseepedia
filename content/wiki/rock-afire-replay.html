<b><i>Rock-afire Replay</b></i> was the first digital animatronics simulator to ever release, being centered around the Rock-afire Explosion and a small bit of Pizza Time Theatre content, lasting from August 24, 2020 to January 5th, 2021, where the game was deleted due to various pressures from Creative Engineering.
<br>
The game became the basis for many future mods that continued the project, such as the officially authorized by Creative Engineering mod Retromation, alongside continuations by the original creator as Faz-Anim and Reel to Real. The game would lead to two separately developed simulator projects currently in the works by Creative Engineering. 
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Beginnings</h3>
The game would begin development on August 14th, 2020, with the modeling of Billy Bob's animatronic mech. The next week would be finishing up the model, making a simple stage, animating the movements, and putting it together in Unity. The game's first version would be released in the "Pizza Time Network" Discord server on August 24th, 2020, consisting of a movable camera and the ability to activate Billy Bob's movements with certain keys. The same day an update would release that added movement recording and file sharing. The game would receive multiple weekly updates over the coming months, adding new characters, stages, costumes, and improved features on creating digital shows.<sup>(1)</sup>
<h3>RAE Simulator</h3>
On October 28th, 2020, the {{< wiki-link "The Rock-afire Explosion Simulator" >}} would be released on Kickstarter by Creative Engineering, developed by Ryan Hayes. This project started planning in April, but didn't have a software build until Octoober, with no prior knowledge of Replay's existence. This project merely had a demo of a Billy Bob face that could move its mouth, while Replay had already a massive suite of content by this point. This led most of the fandom to not consider backing the Simulator project, as Replay was already downloadable for free.
<br>
Creative Engineering would learn of Replay shortly after the Kickstarter's release, with a flood of comments discussing the games. When someone asked if they had seen this before, Aaron replied "No.  I have not given anyone else permission to do this." Aaron would then delete all the comments mentioning Replay, stating 
<blockquote>
"I have removed comments regarding a competitive game to this that was created by someone who has not contacted me to ask for permission to use my copyrights, trademarks, show material, and the rest of my life's work.  I don't have any idea who he is or why he's gone to the trouble of creating a game without asking to work with me. I've already signed a deal with Ryan to build this game before Ryan and I even knew there was someone doing a similar game.  If anyone knows who the creator of the game is that is similar to what we are creating here, please let me know.  I am curious as to why someone would make such an investment in something this complex without first getting the rights to distribute it.  Maybe he can change his game to a FNAF or a CEC or any other characters, but I would highly advise him to check with the copyright owners before doing the work." "...And , if you know who he is,  please invite the creator of the knock off game to introduce himself to me."<sup>(2)</sup>
</blockquote>
The 64th Gamer would reply stating the game as simply a passion project, and to hope the official simulator could co-exist with it. Aaron would then offer to have them work with him and Ryan on the RAE Simulator, noting:<sup>(2)</sup>
<blockquote> 
"I'll be very disappointed if we can't take this opportunity not only to have 64th's talent on our team, but also to unite behind this goal.  It's true that in my vision, 64th doesn't control this project, but he was never entitled to that.  His vision and talent is greatly respected by me.  But his vision doesn't go as far as Ryan and I are promising the fans with absolute accurate simulation of the real world effects on these moving parts, and the tools to program these characters that will become the actual tools that I myself will use to program my own show." "...Without financial success, a demo like 64th has given us cannot survive and develop further."<sup>(2)</sup>
</blockquote>
There was also some potential worry that since Aaron did not know who 64th was, that he was part of one of the few harassment groups within the fandom. 64th would contact Aaron about a collaboration, but would cease communication after Aaron required 64th's full legal name to proceed talks.<sup>(2)</sup> On November 26, 2020, the RAE Sim would be cancelled, as now the full fandom's attention had been moved to Replay's ongoing development.
<h3>Fan Shows</h3>
Over the coming days and weeks from the launch of the Kickstarter, Aaron would become highly agitated of the fandom's ability to make showtapes of any song or audio they wished with Aaron's characters, despite this also being a feature of the RAE Simulator. He would write:
<blockquote> 
"...You should see the s*** I took down last night.  Without me fighting for the Rock-afire, it would be destroyed quickly.  If you guys want to program simulated animatronic characters to do and say whatever you want, why don't you make up your own characters?  Why do you have to destroy my life's work?"
<br>
"...I asked the creator of Replay to talk to me about these concerns.  But he has not contacted me.  Meanwhile, I have asked that people who publish Rock-afire content ask me to approve it.  Letting every 13 year old with no filter and an enjoyment of watching the characters cuss is not the future of The Rock-afire.  I have never had a problem with fan art, but these videos crossed the line into a "content" category that will lead to the ruin of the Rock-afire if not controlled."<sup>(2)</sup>
</blockquote>
Aaron would then release his "Olive Branch for Rock-afire Replay" video on November 16th, which had now finally addressed the game to CEI's subscribers. The video would detail a process to have fan-shows approved by Aaron before being uploaded to YouTube, otherwise they would by copyright striked. Despite CEI's showtapes in the 2010's using profanity, Aaron claimed since the release of Five Night's at Freddy's that he wanted the Rock-afire to return to more family friendly content from the influx of kids now discovering his channel. Around this time, an infamous fan-show of the song "Ram Ranch" would appear on YouTube, which would become Aaron's catalyst for enforcing the policing of fan-content.
<br>
The video also continued Aaron's begrudging support for the project despite being ghosted by 64th, stating that he wanted to eventually program shows in Replay, and hold contests for fan shows.
