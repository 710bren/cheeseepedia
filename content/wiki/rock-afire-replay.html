<b><i>Rock-afire Replay</b></i> was the first digital animatronics simulator to ever release, lasting from August 24, 2020 to January 5th, 2021, where the game was deleted due to various pressures from Creative Engineering.
<br>
The game became the basis for many future mods that continued the project, such as the officially authorized by Creative Engineering mod Retromation, alongside continuations by the original creator as Faz-Anim and Reel to Real. The game would lead to two separately developed simulator projects currently in the works by Creative Engineering. 
<h2>History</h2>
The game's first version would be released in the "Pizza Time Network" Discord server on August 24th, 2020 after a few weeks of development.
