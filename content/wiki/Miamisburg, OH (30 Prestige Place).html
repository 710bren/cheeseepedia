<b><i>Miamisburg, OH (30 Prestige Place), Store #555</b></i> was a Showbiz Pizza Place that opened on November 25, 1981 with a Rock-Afire Explosion.

This location received CU in the early 1990's, and would then replace the 3-Stage with a Studio C Beta in 2001 and had it until they got 2.0 in October 2022.

As of January 2023, they still have the 2.0 Remodel.

<h2> Stages</h2>

The store opened with the Rock Afire Explosion on November 25, 1981, then started [[Concept Unification Installation Manual|Concept Unification]] in around 1991/1992 which began the process of converting the Rock Afire Explosion to the 3-stage.

They had the 3-stage from 1991/1992 till 2001, In 2001 the store removed its 3-Stage and had it replaced by a Studio C Beta with a 32m bot produced by Garner Holt. This bot, due to it being one of the first betas, also had late night on the Studio C bot. It is currently unknown when they replaced the Late Night outfit with the 'Cool Chuck' outfit. 

In the late 2000s, the location gained an Avenger hat and shirt, though he would keep his Cool Chuck khakis until it got the Rockstar outfit in the mid 2010s. 

The store was one of the last to have a working bluescreen, even after the Ticket Blaster was added in, only removing it in 2012, due to programming for it being discontinued. 

In the mid 2010s, the location would start to get the Rockstar outfit, often having the animatronic with the khakis + Rockstar shirt or the Avenger shirt + Rockstar pants. By the late 2010s, though, it would have the full outfit. 

In early October of 2022, the store converted to a 2.0, with the Studio C Beta being gutted and replaced with a 2021 Model Chuck E. Live Dance Floor with a Video Wall. The Studio C Beta's black walls can still be seen if you look closely through the windows of one of the employee doors, this location does not currently have a custom location poster, and has four of the five character posters, save for Jasper T. Jowls, though his blue background does exist at the location.

<h2>History </h2>
Miamisburg opened on November 25th, 1981 as the 3rd ShowBiz Pizza store in Ohio (3rd after [[Sharonville, OH (1429 E Kemper Rd)|Sharonville]] & [[Cincinnati, OH (8801 Colerain Ave)|Cincinnati Colerain]]) with a Rock-afire Explosion show. Like many other ShowBiz Pizza locations, it had a typical SPP layout seen in many other stores across the United States and would eventually receive the 1988 remodel years after it would open. Although some little documentation exists back in the ShowBiz days, it can be determined that Miamisburg was one of several locations to receive an Uncle Klunk show package (and a Santa Claus retrofit package as well) sometime after opening. Like many ShowBiz locations in the late 1980s, Miamisburg received the Showbiz Pizza Campground upgrade.

In around 1991, Miamisburg received Concept Unification which converted the show to Munch's Make Believe Band. In around the Mid 1990's, Miamisburg received the [[Phase 1 (1994)|Phase 1]] remodel which removed some early 90's decor, added new decor, SkyTubes, and an exterior remodel. 

Then in 2001, Miamisburg would remodel to [[Phase 3 (2000)|Phase 3]] which involved removing most of the 1990's decor and replacing the 3-Stage for a [[Studio C 2000|Studio C 2000, 32m]]. Then they remodeled to the 2005 Remodel in around 2006. The store then expanded in 2009 which involved another exterior remodel and adding more space for games. 

The store would remove it's [Skytubes]({{< ref "wiki/Skytubes.html" >}}) and the Tik Tak Clock ride after reopening after the COVID pandemic in the summer of 2020. Meanwhile, new games, like Luigi's Mansion Arcade, would be added around that time.

In October 2022, Miamisburg would remodel to 2.0, removing the Studio C for Dance Floor + Video Wall.
