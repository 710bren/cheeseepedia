[[File:DavenportCommercial.jpg|thumb]] This commercial was created in early 1981 and advertises the opening of the [Davenport, IA]({{< ref "wiki/Davenport, IA (903 E Kimberly Rd).md" >}}) ShowBiz Pizza Place. The commercial is 30 seconds long. It opens with [Fats Gorilla]({{< ref "wiki/Fats Gorilla (Animatronic).md" >}}) of the [Wolf Pack 5]({{< ref "wiki/Wolf Pack 5.md" >}}) at the Kansas City (Antioch), MO (2726 NE Vivion Rd) (Kansas City (Antioch), MO) location. The commercial then shows [Jacksonville (Atlantic), FL]({{< ref "wiki/Jacksonville, FL (9820 Atlantic Blvd).md" >}})’s Rock-afire Explosion show. The ad then shows people eating pizza, with a few seconds of the Billy Bob animatronic shown, then shows Fats Gorilla from the Wolf Pack 5, a woman enjoying some pizza with [Dingo Starr]({{< ref "wiki/Dingo Starr (Animatronic).md" >}}) visible in the background, and two people playing Whac-A-Mole. The ad then concludes with a ShowBiz Pizza Place logo on a blue background with lights around the logo flashing, and text above and below the logo saying “903 E. KIMBERLY DAVENPORT OPENS WEDNESDAY”.
