<p><h2>History</h2></p>
<p>5501 E 82nd St opened on April 28th, 1982 and had a Rock-Afire Explosion and a standard exterior like every other Showbiz. They would strangely receive the 1988 remodel in Mid 1991 removing older SPP decor for CU decor, the Blue and White awnings, the new salad bar, and the checkers on the walls but keeping the Rock-Afire Explosion. This wouldn't last long as around Fall 1991, they would receive Concept Unification and receive the Concept Unification decor and kept the 'Showbiz Pizza' name until 1993. In around the Mid 1990's, They would receive either <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Phase 1 (1994)" >}}">Phase 1</a> or <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Phase 2 (1997)" >}}">Phase 2</a> which added a lot of 1990s decor and assets such as the Record Posters and Colored Chase Lights and still keeping the 1988 remodel exterior.  In the year 2000, they received the Phase 3 remodel which marked the end of the 3-Stage. It was replaced by the Studio C Alpha and got a new exterior and most of the early 90s decor was removed and the late 90's and 2000's decor and SkyTubes were added. Somewhere between 2008 or 2009, it would undergo the 2005 remodel which involved the exterior, the removal of the early 2000's posters, the expansion of the store, the removal of the Showroom Walls, relocating the stage, and the new decor. In June-July 2018, the store temporarily closed due to flood damage. In October 2018, they would undergo the 2.0 remodel removing the flood damaged Alpha<sup>[1]</sup><sup>[2]</sup> for the Dance Floor. Their grand reopening would be held on January 19th, 2019 <sup>[3]</sup>.</p>
