The wiki's category system uses <b><i>Tabberneue</b></i> to categorize sections. 

These are always sectioned into <i>Pizza Time Theatre, ShowBiz Pizza Place, Chuck E. Cheese's,</i> and <i>Creative Engineering.</i> If one of the companies doesn't apply to that category (such as Pizza Time Theatre in a Website category), remove that tab. If the tab is otherwise blank from a lack of entries, keep it blank to encourage further contribution.
