**_2239 148th Ave**_ is a _Chuck E. Cheese's_ that opened in Spring 1996 (month and day unknown) and is still open today with a [[1-Stage]].

##  Stage ## 
Bellevue opened with a [[1-Stage]], which they still have to this day. It is rumored this stage came from the now closed [[Milwaukee, WI (7401 Good Hope Rd)]] store. They at first had the tuxedo outfit, later the Cool Chuck outfit. The curtains were disabled sometime in the 2005 time period, and later completely removed all together. Chuck E. later got the Avenger outfit, removing the cap by the end of 2013.

##  History ## 
Bellevue opened sometime in Spring 1996 (month and day unknown) with a [\2](\1) remodel. Unfortunately, there isn't much info on Bellevue from around this time. In 2008/2009, Bellevue received the 2005 update to the [[2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative]], which involved the removal of 90s decor, showroom walls, balcony seating, and the addition of purple walls and an exterior change. As of August 2023, Bellevue remains like this.
