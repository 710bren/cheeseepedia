The Chuck E. Cheese in Stevenson Ranch (also known as Valencia) CA opened in 1996 or 1997. It was one of the last 1-stages installed. In January 2023, the location received the 2.0 remodel, removing the stage for a dance floor and TV wall. The animatronics from the location were sent to the Pasadena CA location, replacing the 2-stage animatronics they had. In February 2024, Pasadena would get the 2.0 remodel.
