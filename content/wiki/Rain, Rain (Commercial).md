'Rain, Rain' is a commercial created in 2002 that was mostly a song based on children's song, 'Rain, Rain, Go Away'

<h2>Summary</h2>
The commercial begins with Chuck E. sitting outside of a home with 3 children while its raining, Chuck E. raises his hand then the rain quickly clears up.

It then cuts to the three children playing and eating at a decorated Chuck E. Cheese's. 

Before the commercial ends a second rain cloud appears over one of the children, but Chuck E.  swats the cloud away before it could rain.
