The <b><i>Pizza Time Theatre Showtape</b></i> was the first ever [Pizza Time Theatre]({{< ref "wiki/Pizza Time Theatre.md" >}}) showtape to be made, premiering with the opening of the [San Jose, CA (370 S Winchester Blvd)]({{< ref "wiki/San Jose, CA (370 S Winchester Blvd).md" >}}) location on May 17, 1977.

The showtape debuted the original <i>Pizza Time Players</i>, including the short-lived <i>Crusty the Cat.</i> 

<h2> Production </h2>

<h2>= D2 Tape Recording </h2>=
At some point after the original showtape was produced, the original audio of the recording sessions, alongside edited and final audio, would be copied to D2 tape, which is the only currently known surviving record that the showtape existed.

The segments on the tape included the original voice demos for the showtape, along with original recordings of songs in the showtape. The demo voice tracks has John Widelock as most of the characters, with Scott Paulin making a small appearence as Jasper in the theme song, and the Warblettes being voiced by Buffy Sainte-Marie. These tracks include:<ref>http://www.showbizpizza.com/review/ptt/1977_crusty.html</ref>
