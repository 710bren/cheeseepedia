##History##
###CEC (July 1992-Present)###
Erie had its grand opening in July 1992, and was built as part of the shopping center it was in. This store opened with the 1988 remodel and game package, with the stage being the 2-Stage. Unfortunately, no photos or videos of Erie from back then have surfaced, and it is unknown if any exist. Around the late 90's, Erie received the 1993 Remodel, getting new signage with Coach Chuck in a star cap, removing older decor for newer decor, removed the Blue and White awnings, and replacing the ball pit with SkyTubes and the Toddler Zone. Erie would remain like this until 2006-2007 when they would receive the 2005 Remodel removing older decor for newer decor, removed the Toddler Zone, removed the Showroom Walls, and relocated the stage. Currently, as of April 2023, the store still has the 2005 Remodel and the 2-Stage.
