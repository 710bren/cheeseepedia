##History##
###CEC (July 1992-Present)###
Erie had its grand opening as a Franchised location in July 1992, and was built as part of the shopping center it was in. This store opened with the 1988 remodel and game package, with the stage being the 2-Stage. The oldest known footage of the store was a tape for employee's that summited footage of various live performances (The store was featured alongside [Wilmington, NC]({{< ref "wiki/Wilmington, NC (4389 Oleander Dr).md" >}}), [San Jose, CA (2445 Fontaine Rd)]({{< ref "wiki/San Jose, CA (2445 Fontaine Rd).md" >}}), [Albuquerque, NM (4418 Wyoming Blvd)]({{< ref "wiki/Albuquerque, NM (4418 Wyoming Blvd).md" >}}), [Mesa, AZ (856 S Alma School Rd)]({{< ref "wiki/Mesa, AZ (856 S Alma School Rd).md" >}}), [Dothan]({{< ref "wiki/Dothan, AL (3400 Ross Clark Circle).md" >}}), [Harrisburg]({{< ref "wiki/Harrisburg, PA (3883 Union Deposit Rd).md" >}}), [Tallahassee]({{< ref "wiki/Tallahassee, FL (2810 Sharer Rd).md" >}}), [Merced]({{< ref "wiki/Merced, CA (721 W Olive Ave).md" >}}), & [Tracy]({{< ref "wiki/Tracy, CA (775 W Clover Rd).md" >}})) which showed footage of the 2-Stage when it was brand new; with no curtains and early 90's masks & cosmetics. Around the late 90's, Erie received the 1993 Remodel, getting new signage with Coach Chuck in a star cap, removing older decor for newer decor, removed the Blue and White awnings, and replacing the ball pit with SkyTubes and the Toddler Zone. On June 17th, 2002, Erie would be bought out by Corporate alongside [Bridgeville]({{< ref "wiki/Bridgeville, PA (1025 Washington Pike).md" >}}) & [Monroeville]({{< ref "wiki/Monroeville, PA (3800 William Penn Hwy).md" >}}). Erie would remain like this until 2006-2007 when they would receive the 2005 Update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative removing older decor for newer decor, & removed the Showroom Walls. In around 2012-2013, the exterior awning was replaced and they removed the rest of their showroom walls. The Skytubes was removed not long after that. The Toddler Zone was then removed during the COVID-19 Pandemic. In October 2023, the location received the 2.0 remodel, with the 2-stage being removed. Currently, as of November 2023, the store still has the 2.0 update with the dance floor and video wall.
