##History##
Lakewood opened on March 23rd, 1983, as part of an expansion of the shopping center it was in. Unfortunately, there is not much information on this location when it was a Showbiz Pizza. This location had the Rock-Afire Explosion Classic Stage. In 1988 or 1989, Lakewood would receive the 1988 remodel removing older SPP decor for newer decor, and the change to the Billy Bob stage (Showbiz Pizza Campground). Around Early 1991, Lakewood would receive Concept Unification and receive the Concept Unification decor and a new exterior. In around the Mid 1990's, Lakewood would receive either [https://chuckepedia.com/wiki/Phase_1_(1994) Phase 1] or [https://chuckepedia.com/wiki/Phase_2_(1997) Phase 2] which added a lot of 1990s decor and assets such as the Record Posters and Colored Chase Lights.  In the year 2000, Lakewood would receive the so called Phase 3 remodel which marked the end of the 3-Stage as it was replaced by the Studio C Alpha and got a new exterior (Which involved an expansion of the front of the store to make room for more games) and most of the 90s decor was removed and the 2000's decor and SkyTubes was added. In Early 2009, it would undergo the 2005 remodel which involved the expansion of the exterior and store, the removal of the early 2000's posters, and the new decor and booths. Currently, as of February 2023, Lakewood still has the 2005 Remodel and the Studio C Alpha stage and is safe from the 2.0 remodel.
##Stages##
