**_Blvd Liberación 6-31, Zona 9**_ was a franchised _Chuck E. Cheese's_ that opened in 1996 with a  and [2-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/2-Stage.md" >}}) show, and closed in 2016.

This location in particular appeared to be an anchor store for its own shopping center, 'Chuck E. Cheese's Center', up until 2010. Little information is known about the shopping center this CEC location sat in, or why the center was named after Chuck E. Cheese's.
##Stages##
When Zona 9 first opened, it housed a 3-Stage in it's Chuck E. Cheese's building and a 2-Stage in a separate event area in the shopping center. It is speculated that the show came from a closed location in the United States, however evidence is limited. Once the event area was retired, the Cyberamic characters' parts were later reused on the 3-Stage show.

The 3-Stage show appeared to never receive any sort of maintenance for its entire run. The only things that were to be done to the show other were a few cosmetic changes from the Cyberamic characters and custom made pieces and giving Chuck E., Helen, and Munch plastic masks.

The 3-Stage animatronics were finally relocated once again to the  location as a static display piece, Pasqually now wearing a walkaround head.
