## History## 
Pasadena opened as a corporate-owned Showbiz Pizza Place on June 9th, 1982. Sadly, there is hardly any documentation of Pasadena when it was a Showbiz Pizza. They would receive the 1988 remodel a few years later removing old Showbiz decor for newer decor.

Pasadena received Concept Unification in 1991 which involved the removal of the Rock-Afire Explosion for the 3-Stage, removal of all SPP decor for newer decor, and a change to the exterior. In the Mid-Late 90's, they received the Phase 3 remodel which removes early 90's decor, added newer decor and SkyTubes. This also applies to the exterior. They would remain like this until their closure in February 2007 (day unknown). It is unknown why they relocated but we could assume the shopping center the location was in was abandoned and it was the only one open. After closure, they were abandoned for a year being filled by multiple businesses until they all closed to become a Dollar Tree. Currently, as of February 2023, the location is still a Dollar Tree.
