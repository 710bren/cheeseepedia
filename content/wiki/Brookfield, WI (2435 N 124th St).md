**_2435 N 124th St**_ was a Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre that opened in August 1982 (day unknown) with a Balcony Stage and relocated in 1997 (month and day unknown) with a 1-Stage.

This location relocated to [[Brookfield, WI (19125 W Blue Mound Rd)]] which opened on December 17, 1997 with the very first Studio C Alpha, and is still open to this day.

##  History ## 
Brookfield's Pizza Time Theatre opened in August 1982 (day unknown) with a Balcony Stage. Unfortunately, information on Brookfield's PTT is very scarce. In 1989/1990, they received the 1988 remodel, which involved removing all PTT decor for SPT decor, added awnings above the counters, added checkers inside and outside of the store, and replaced the Balcony Stage with Chuck E.'s House Facade. Brookfield remained like this until 1994, when they receive the 1993 remodel, which involved removing older decor for newer decor, changed the exterior, removed some of the checkers, and replaced Chuck E.'s House Facade for a 1-Stage with a turntable. For unknown reasons, in 1997 (month and day unknown), the location shut its doors and relocated. As of June 2023, a business takes up the space.
