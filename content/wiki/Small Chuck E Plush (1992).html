This plush has a simple design that has been used on many other small Chuck E. Plushies before. It has a rounded, well-stuffed body with two stubby arms and two stubby legs with two pink patches of fur to represent his feet. It's head is rounded off with a pink snout that has a plastic nose, string whiskers, and felt teeth. Its eyes are plastic and have a black outline wrapping around them and separating its dark grey eyelids. Its eyebrows are black felt circles cut into two pieces. It's vest is directly attached to its body and has two felt buttons on it's yellow undershirt. The plush's bowtie is sewn onto the plush's chin, being mostly covered by its teeth. The plush's red hat has a golden ribbon wrapping around it. The plush's fur is very soft and the plush overall is very high quality.

The front of the plush's tag says 'Chuck E Cheese ®  © 1992 SHOWBIZ PIZZA TIME, INC,' the back of it says 'ALL NEW MATERIALS

CONTENTS, ACRYLIC FIBER OHIO 14268 PA 1844 MASS T 714 MADE IN CHINA'.
