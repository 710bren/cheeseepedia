The <b>Cheesy Television (Must C TV Award)</b> was a poster created for Chuck E. Cheese in 1998.
<h2> Design </h2>
This poster features a astronaut with Chuck E.'s ears with a flag that reads 'C TV' in the background you can see his spaceship which is made out of cheese. This Must C Tv poster is parody of the MTV channel which at the time their mascot was a astronaut hold a 'MTV' flag.
<h2> Size/Dimensions </h2>
Like the other 'Must C TV' posters, this was made larger than actual TV posters, so it'd be cheaper and easier to retrofit the Phase 2 'record posters' with them.
<h2> Reception </h2>
The poster originally received generally positive reception upon release, however, as time passed, it began to get a more negative reception, with many critics of the Original Phase Trilogy using this as a literal poster child for showing how dated pre-2005 Chuck E. Cheese's stores are. Nowadays, it does have a cult following, either due to how absurd the poster is, or due to the 90s nostalgia boom.
