**_The Singing Flowers**_ were prop characters at _Pizza Time Theatre_ restaurants. They were designed to replace the [Warblettes]({{< ref "wiki/Warblettes (Cyberamic).md" >}}) when a _Balcony Stage_ was converted to a _Rocker_ or _C Stage_. They were very simple characters with only a single mouth lever inside them. They would use the same bit as the Warblettes Mouth and this allowed the Warblettes to still function on stages that still had them.

_The Singing Flowers_ were phased out during the introduction of the _Road, 1 and 2 Stages_. They were still programmed throughout the 90's and until 1999-2001, as corporate had a set installed on their _Road Stage_. They likely went extinct around then as photos of _Rocker Stages_ in the late 90s and 2000's do not have them anymore. Some stages seemed to never even have these installed at all.
