This was the 2nd to last new store to open with a 2-Stage as the others after the opening of [[Pasadena, CA (3737 E Foothill Blvd)|Pasadena]] in October (Except Santiago (Mall Plaza Vespucio), Chile which uses a 2-Stage from a closed PTT, [Guatemala City, Guatemala (Blvd Liberación 6-31, Zona 9)]({{< ref "wiki/Guatemala City, Guatemala (Blvd Liberación 6-31, Zona 9).html" >}}) which used a reused show as well, [Chesapeake, VA (1528 Sam's Circle)]({{< ref "wiki/Chesapeake, VA (1528 Sam's Circle).html" >}}) which uses [[Merced, CA (721 W Olive Ave)|Merced]]'s former 2-Stage & [[Virginia Beach, VA (2699 Lishelle Place)|Virginia Beach, VA]] uses a 2-Stage from a closed PTT.) were all 1-Stages. The store would open with the Tuxedo & Derby outfit like every other MMBB stage had at the time.

In 2013-2014, Miami (Biscayne) would receive the 2013 Update which involved remodeling the front counter, replacing the dim lighting with bright florescent lighting, and expanding the store, adding more room for games. The store would remain this way until April 2022 when the store would remodel to the [[2017 2.0 Remodel Program|2017 2.0 Remodel]] which involving building the video wall on the left side wall to the 2-Stage then removing it afterwards.
