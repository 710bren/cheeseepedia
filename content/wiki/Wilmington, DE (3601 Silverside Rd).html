<h2> History </h2>
TODO: History

<h2> Stages </h2>
Originally when the store opened, they had a Rock-Afire Explosion, as all other Showbiz locations had. In the early 1990's, the store would undergo Concept Unification, turning the RAE into Munch's Make-Believe Band. On September 16th, 1996, the store was bought out by Corporate. They would have the 3-Stage until September 2017, when they would receive the Circles of Light stage from San Antonio, TX (6874 Ingram Dr) because of a faulty sprinkler system; damaging the 3-Stage and causing its removal. They would have the COL stage until October 12, 2020, when they would close because of the COVID-19 pandemic. On October 2nd, 2022, they reopened the store as a 2.0 with a Dance Floor.
