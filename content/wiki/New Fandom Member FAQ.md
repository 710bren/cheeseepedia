Hello new user, it seems you're interested in the lost media for _Pizza Time Theatre / ShowBiz Pizza Place / Chuck E. Cheese's / Creative Engineering_. This is a crash course on the fandom, the inner workings of CEC, and what you can do to help.

##  Resources ## 
Outside of manually finding sources through newspaper.com, archive.org, and home videos on YouTube, there are a few places the fandom has compiled information on outside of Cheese-E-Pedia.

# http://www.showbizpizza.com/ is a site created in the early 2000's that was the original history book for everything. It is the easiest way to ease yourself into the history of the companies, as its articles talk about broader and interweaving concepts. However, new articles haven't been written in almost a decade, leaving many pages blank, and nothing in the modern era discussed at all.
# https://www.cectokens.com/ is a site documenting all the tokens and tickets to have ever existed, alongside many errors in production.
# [https://web.archive.org/web/20071015093425/http://showbizpizzaforum.com/archive/index.php?f-5.html ShowBiz Pizza Forum]  was the first forums ever from 2000-2014. Not many articles have been saved on Wayback, but some rare bits of information may be within its pages. It was abandoned in 2014 after being infected with adware.
# [https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/retro_pizza_zone/ Retro Pizza Zone] was the original forums between 2014-2018. Many knowledgeable members who had worked for the companies in the 80's and 90's have lots of information and pictures on there. It was abandoned after Zetaboards merged with Tapatalk and ruined the site's user interface.
# When looking for images of rare signs, parts, robots, ect, accounts on Instagram have their collections posted. This is where a lot of the fandom moved to after 2018, but are now mostly on Discord servers.

##  Community Terms & Concepts ## 

# The community always refers to lost media as 'data'.
# Many items from stores will be kept by their employees after their closure, and usually be sold or given to members of the community. This is how many pieces of lost media will surface decades later. They'll either show up on eBay, the person will join the fandom looking to give them away, or someone will happen to know them. These are generally just random people who happened to work at any store within these past 40 years.
# It is mostly frowned upon in the community to post videos of stores destroying their animatronics, or posting anything showing an animatronic in a private collection (With it having the cosmetics of the copyrighted character on it. Bare mechs, or Rock-afire characters aren't included). This is due to the bad reputation these videos can give to CEC Entertainment, which has promoted them to be more vigilant in destroying animatronics further.
# Almost every major employee, corporate leader, and private collector has been contacted about information and lost media, and current ones are being handled by the admin team and major members of the fandom. It is generally not worth seeking out new contacts due to this.
# This is more thoroughly explained in [\2](\1), but due to the fandom not having too many outlets to properly document information for the past 20 years, lots and lots of information is just presumed to be known by its members. Cheese-E-Pedia is trying to be the site to correct for this, but we are still many years from getting everything listed with sources. A lot of our sources also come from employee testimony, which can make it difficult to research some subjects. It is recommended to ask the community for anything you don't understand. It is garunteed that multiple people will be able to help you and point you in the right direction.
# Originally the fandom was much more oriented over ShowBiz Pizza Place and The Rock-afire Explosion, as many agree they are the superior band with a very talented voice crew and engineering team. This has however changed in recent years following the owner of Creative Engineering, Aaron Fechter, having various scandals and being generally overprotective of his IP. Many have pivoted to CEC for their love of animatronics as to not support Aaron's endeavors.

##  Important Information ## 
Lots of important understandings of how things work and certain company history is generally not covered in documentary videos. These are some tips to help ground yourself when looking for something.

# 'Showtapes', are a physical piece of media that contains generally 30 mins - 2 hours of musical content. They are all generally formatted to have a  hidden audio channel that passes through [\2](\1) to the computer for processing, which aren't usually posted online. Stores have always received new showtapes every few months for the past 40 years, and they usually just keep older tapes in a storage room or throw them away, as it is not permitted to play previous tapes. Showtapes take on different formats throughout the years:
## 70's to mid 80's: 2-4 Track Reel
## Mid 80's to Mid 2000's: SVHS Tape
## Mid 2000's to 2023: DVD
## [[Studio C]] shows have their animation signals split onto a Floppy Disc.
## 2023+: [[Navori System]] transfers from the cloud. No longer on any physical medium.
# _Pizza Time Theatre_ and _ShowBiz Pizza Place_ merged their companies in 1984 as is known, but internally- this was basically a takeover by ShowBiz. While the Pizza Time Theatre name was still used up until the late 80's, the usual running of stores by PTT was never the same after the merger. This is why the wiki is formatted to cut off all PTT categories at that year.
# CEC since 2017 has spent a majority of their budget on the [\2](\1).
