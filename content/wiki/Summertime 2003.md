*'America' was originally used as a America  ( live show). In this show programming for Chuck E. has been added and the footage has been changed to stock footage of an American flag. 
*'Boat of Love' and 'We Sail The Ocean Blue' are reused from [August 1999]({{< ref "wiki/August 1999.md" >}}). They do not have programming in this show.
*'Baking With Betty' is reused from [April 2002 Show]({{< ref "wiki/April 2002 Show.md" >}}) and 'Monkey Ninjas' is reused from [September 2002 Show]({{< ref "wiki/September 2002 Show.md" >}})
*All of the countdowns are reused from [September 2002 Show]({{< ref "wiki/September 2002 Show.md" >}}). They have been shortened from 7 minutes to 3 minutes.
*The Kool-Aid spot advertises a promotion which ended in 2001. This was removed for Studio C by the Version 1.2 floppy.
