**_1154 East Ogden Avenue**_ was a _Showbiz Pizza/Chuck E. Cheese_ that opened on April 4, 1983 as a Corporate _Showbiz Pizza Place_ with a [https://chuckepedia.com/wiki/Classic_Stage Rock-Afire Explosion] and closed on March 1, 2015 with a Studio C Alpha.

##History##
Naperville opened its doors on April 4th, 1983 with a Rock-afire Explosion show. It was originally a corporate-owned store. Like many other Showbiz Pizza locations, it had a typical SPP layout seen in many other stores across the United States and would eventually receive the 1988 remodel years after it would open in 1988-1989 removing older SPP decor for newer SPP decor, and changing the Billy Bob stage. Unfortunately, very little documentation exists back in the ShowBiz Pizza era.

In around 1991, Naperville received Concept Unification which converted the show to Munch's Make Believe Band with a new exterior and removing al SPP decor for CU decor, adding Blue and White awnings above the salad bar, and added checkers around and outside the store. Around the Mid-Late 1990's, Naperville received the [https://chuckepedia.com/wiki/Phase_1_(1994) Phase 1] or [https://chuckepedia.com/wiki/Phase_2_(1997) Phase 2] remodel which removed some early 90's decor and added new decor, added SkyTubes in place of the ball pit, and also an exterior change. The 3-Stage was removed for the Studio C Alpha in 2000. Naperville remained this way until sometime in 2006-2007 when they received the 2005 Remodel (Phase 4) which involved removing the Showroom Walls, Balcony Seating, relocating the stage, and also removing some older 90's decor. Naperville would remain like this until March 1st, 2015 when they relocated for unknown reasons, probably due to parking or lease issues. After relocation, Naperville would remain abandoned for a few months until in 2016 when they would become a HomeWerks furniture store. As of March 2023, the HomeWerks is still here.
