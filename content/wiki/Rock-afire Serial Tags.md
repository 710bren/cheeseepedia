The **_Rock-afire Serial Tag**_ is a metal tag with a serial code placed on all Rock-afire Explosion animatronics and electronics, which gives info on the piece and when it was produced. 

These tags are usually placed at the hips or near the feet of most animatronics. Fatz's keyboard has it placed on the back of the right leg. Beach Bear and Dook's tag is on the bottom frame base.

The main information is a set of numbers pressed into the metal, creating a four number serial code. Certain tags between 1980 and 1981 would additionally have a smaller print production number pressed, though usually being the only number on the tag. It is unclear what the production number means, as none of the ones uncovered line up with any sort of knowledge on animatronics or characters produced. Because of the closure of all Showbiz Pizza Place's, serial codes are now useful for tracking which store an animatronic came from, or identifying the ownership history of a particular bot.

A Rock-afire serial code would look like this:
 10-81 12-16
*The first number is the month the bot was produced. This is for the main robot frame, as cosmetics would usually take longer to produce. This is why dates on the tag and marks on the body shells/cosmetics can be mismatched.
*The second number is the year of production.
*The third number is the _serial key_, which would determine what type of animatronic or equipment the serial code is describing. In the case of the example above, this would be the serial key for Fatz's keyboard.
*The fourth number would be the _batch number_ for that month. A batch refers to a single Rock-afire Explosion band, meaning each character would have the same batch number at any given store. Batches for a month were always in multiples of five, and would most commonly be produced in _January, April, July,_ and _October._
