<p><h2> History </h2></p>
<p>In 1999, the Discovery Zone located in Parma OH closed as part of their bankruptcy and was one of the 13 locations reopened as a Chuck E. Cheese's, featuring a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Studio C Alpha" >}}">Studio C Alpha.</a></p>
<p>The store would remain practically untouched, save for Chuck's Late-Night outfit being replaced in 2008, the relocation of the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Skytubes" >}}">Sky Tubes</a> from the front gameroom to the back gameroom in 2012, the disabling of the curtains in 2016 and the removal of the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Interactive Console" >}}">Interactive Console</a> and Blue Screen camera in 2016 and 2014, respectively, until 2016,</p>
<p>At this time, Parmatown Mall, the shopping center the store is located in, was torn down and its plaza refurbished. While Chuck E. Cheese's would remain standing, it would be receiving a new exterior. The new exterior was installed in late 2016 and featured Rockstar Chuck E.</p>
<p>The interior of the store would keep its 1999 appearance until August 2017 when Parma was ordered to undergo the 2015 Remodel, along with <a href="{{< ref "wiki/North Olmsted, OH (26104 Great Northern Sh)" >}}">North Olmsted, OH.</a> The store kept its showroom walls and balcony seating, which stores typically removed while remodeling. It also kept other 1999 elements such as: the beverage sign, welcome signing, and dim showroom lighting. The only other change the store would see after this was the complete removal of the Skytubes during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Parma began the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/CEC 2018 20 Remodel Program" >}}">2.0 remodel</a> on May 12th 2024. The <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Studio C Alpha" >}}">Studio C Alpha</a> was destroyed on the first night of the remodel. The balcony seating and showroom walls would be kept during the remodel.</p>
<p><h2> Fight </h2></p>
<p>On March 9th, 2015, several patrons began attacking kitchen staff over a game malfunctioning. The police were called, and charges were filed.</p>
