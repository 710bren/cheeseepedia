<h2> History </h2>
Tracy opened in 1983 (month and day unknown) with a [Balcony Stage]({{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage.md" >}}) and the standard PTT remodel. However, information on Tracy as a PTT or in general is hard to find. In 1989/1990, they received the 1988 update to the 1986 SPT Remodel Program, which involved uniting the counters, merging the Fantasy Forest and lobby rooms, added checkers inside and outside of the store, replacing the decor, changed the location's name to <i>Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza</i>, and removed the Balcony Stage for [Chuck E.'s House Facade]({{< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House Facade.md" >}}). In mid-1992, the store was featured in a reel along with [Wilmington, NC]({{< ref "wiki/Wilmington, NC (4389 Oleander Dr).md" >}}), [San Jose (Fontaine/Tully), CA]({{< ref "wiki/San Jose, CA (2445 Fontaine Rd).md" >}}), [Albuquerque, NM]({{< ref "wiki/Albuquerque, NM (4418 Wyoming Blvd).md" >}}), [West Mesa, AZ]({{< ref "wiki/Mesa, AZ (856 S Alma School Rd).md" >}}), [Dothan, AL]({{< ref "wiki/Dothan, AL (3400 Ross Clark Circle).md" >}}), [Harrisburg, PA]({{< ref "wiki/Harrisburg, PA (3883 Union Deposit Rd).md" >}}), [Erie, PA]({{< ref "wiki/Erie, PA (7200 Peach St).md" >}}), [Tallahassee, FL]({{< ref "wiki/Tallahassee, FL (2810 Sharer Rd).md" >}}), and [Merced, CA]({{< ref "wiki/Merced, CA (721 W Olive Ave).md" >}}). In 1995, the location closed permanently for unknown reasons. It was passed off to many businesses, and as of July 2023, the location ended up vacant again.
