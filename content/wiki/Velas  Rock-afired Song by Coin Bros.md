**_Velas * Rock-afired Song by Coin Bros**_ is a single segment showtape produced for the _[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjhqAaWA7JZtxm3Mof3KJcA Creative Engineering YouTube channel]._

The song was programmed due to Creative Engineering's previous collaboration with _Coin Bros_ in [Rock-afired for Coin - Sort It Out]({{< ref "wiki/Rock-afired for Coin - Sort It Out.md" >}}), though does not seem to be a direct collaboration this time.
