<b><i>Show 2 2020</b></i> was the Summer show released June 23, 2020 and featured four songs. It as the first CEC show in over 30 years to have no live shows.

This show was created to play after stores went through the staggered re-openings from the COVID-19 lockdown from June 23, 2020 - August 31, 2020.

Of the four songs. two were new and two were reused. Additionally, the Birthday Show was modified to account for the lack of a costumed Chuck E. Cheese.

<h2> Trivia: </h2>

* 'My Family' is originally from Chuck E. Cheese's Show 3 2019 (Show 3 2019) and 'Out of This World' is originally from Chuck E. Cheese's Show 5 2016 (Show 5 2016). 
* This show is different from the originally planned Show 2 2020. The original new content CEC had planned for Show 2 2020 would have included a new Birthday show and two new songs ( 'Chuck E.'s Middle Name' and 'El Rey Guitarrista').  Two new Silly Songs were planned: 'Barbara the Barnyard Barber' and 'Get a Chuck E. Hug'. <ref>https://www.instagram.com/p/B8rbpKtnRzH/</ref>

* Barbara the Barnyard Barber was originally not meant to be programmed and was intended as just an intermission; this changed to account for the lockdown and was quickly programmed.
* The song Chuck E.'s Middle name was eventually finished for Chuck E. Cheese's Show 2 2021 (Show 2 2021).

* The new Birthday Show was to be called 'Birthday Extravaganza' and it was to feature a five minute countdown with three Spots from Matt Daniel during the countdown. It was to use a combination of Show Motion GFX, and live videos with puppets portions of the show. It was also to have Cast Member training and Chuck E. Choreography training videos.<ref>https://www.instagram.com/p/B8rbpKtnRzH/</ref> 
* This show features a brand new 'Live at Home' Birthday which used the Birthday Star Spectacular show modified to make it so the walkaround costume didn't need to appear.
