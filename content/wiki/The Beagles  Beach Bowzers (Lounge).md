##  The Beagles ## 
**_The Beagles**_ are an animatronic cabaret act used in _Pizza Time Theatre_ restaurants.

_The Beagles_ appeared in the Lounge Room. There is photo and video evidence to suggest _The Beagles_ were still around in the 1990's but they were likely phased out very quickly.

There were 4 members of the band, with the same names as the actual _Beatles_. George was the dog standing on the floor, Paul was the guitarist standing on a block, Ringo was the drummer and John was the dog with the microphone. Ringo was often referred to as 'The Smart Beagle' in showtapes.

##  Placement ## 
As mentioned before, _The Beagles_ would be placed in the Lounge at _Pizza Time Theatre_. The layout did have a standard design but this was different in some stores, having them arranged in a completely different order. The cosmetics weren't always the same either. There seems to have been many versions of the masks, varying between gray, black and brown. There was also two different outfits, a Red Shirt and a White Shirt for them. The stage itself is usually just a wooden platform with black, white or red drapes.

##  Showtapes ## 
_The Beagles_ have three known showtapes.

[[Beagles I]]

[[Beagles II]]

[[Beagles III]]

All three use recordings of _Beatles_ songs sandwiched between dialogue recorded by an unknown voice actor. He usually tells a fact about the band at the start, and at the end says something along the lines of 'see you soon'.

##  The Beach Bowsers ## 
**_The Beach Bowsers**_ are an animatronic cabaret act used in _Pizza Time Theatre_ restaurants.

_The Beach Bowsers_ appeared in the Lounge Room. The fact that they got a new showtape in 1991 suggests they were used in a fair amount of locations still at this point, but they were likely all removed before the 90's ended.

There were 4 members of the band, none of which had names. However, the one with the microphone refers to himself as 'Woody Bowser' in the [\2](\1) Showtape.

##  Placement ## 
They are essentially placed in the same layout as _The Beagles_, as they were retrofits.

##  Showtapes ## 
_The Beach Bowsers_ have two known showtapes.

[[Beach Bowsers]]

[\2](\1)

'Beach Bowsers' (the first one) used recordings of _Beach Boys_ songs along with an intro and outro, much like the _Beagles_ showtapes. The 1991 showtape had covers of _Beach Boys_ songs instead of recordings.
