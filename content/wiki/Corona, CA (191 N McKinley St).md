**_191 N McKinley St i**_s a Chuck E. Cheese that opened in May 19, 1992 as a corporate location with a Road Stage which is still open to this day.

It is located next to Denny's that closed in 2020 and a gas station like [[Huntington Beach, CA (15511 Edwards St)]].
## History## 
Corona opened on May 19th, 1992 as a corporate-owned location. Corona opened with the 1988 Remodel including the CU decor, and the Road Stage. Around the mid-late 1990s, They replaced the logo with Coach Chuck and removed older 90's decor for newer decor and the removal of the ball pit for SkyTubes. Corona remained like this until in Summer 2007, when they received the 2005 remodel (Phase 4) which involved the removal of the showroom walls, removing older decor for newer decor, new booths, relocating the stage, & adding purple walls. Corona still remains like this. Currently, as of February 2023, the location still has the 2005 Remodel and the Road Stage.
## Stages## 
Like all Road Stages at the time, Chuck wore his Tuxedo & Derby outfit. Up and Down curtains were added by the Late 90's. In the Early 2000's, this was replaced with the Cool Chuck outfit. By the Late 2000's, Chuck's outfit was replaced with the Avenger outfit. Up and Down curtains were later removed.

As of February 2023, Corona still has the Road Stage and 2005 Remodel.
