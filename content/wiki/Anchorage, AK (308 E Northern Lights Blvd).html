<b><i>308 E Northern Lights Blvd, Store #589</b></i> is a <i>Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre</i>/<i>Chuck E. Cheese</i> that opened on 1982 (month and day currently unknown) with a Balcony Stage, which is still open to this day.

This location has been the only location in the state of Alaska since the Fairbanks, Alaska (600 Old Steese Hwy) location which opened in 1986 and closed in 1988.

<h2> Stages </h2>
Originally when the store opened, they had a Balcony Stage, as all other Pizza Time Theatres did. Unfortunately, there were not many photos or videos of Anchorage back then. They would have it for a few years until the late 80's / early 90's, when they would receive a C-Stage, they would have it for a short time until 1993/1994, when they would receive a 2-Stage, they would have it for a bit, until sometime in 2006, when they would replace it with a Studio C Beta, 16M. They would have the Beta for many years, until July 2022, when they would remove the Beta for a 2021 model Dance Floor and Video Wall, as a part of the 2.0 Remodel. Currently, as of February 2023, they still have the Dance Floor and Video Wall.

<h2> History </h2>
This store was the first to open in the state of Alaska, opening in 1982 (month and day unknown) and originally had a Balcony Stage and was a franchised owned store. Anchorage would receive the 1988 remodel in 1989 or 1990 removing the Balcony Stage for Chuck E.'s House Facade. In around 1993/1994, the Chuck E.'s House Facade was removed for the [2-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/2-Stage.html" >}}). In the Late 90's, Anchorage received the Phase 3 Remodel which removed older 90's decor, added newer decor, and SkyTubes. They would be bought on January 2nd, 2005, by CEC Entertainment and becoming a corporate-owned store. Anchorage received the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative in Fall 2006 which removed the Showroom Walls, Balcony Seating, and relocating the show and replacing the 2-Stage with the Studio C Beta, 16m. Anchorage remained like this until July 2022 when they received the 2.0 Remodel removing the Beta for a 2021 model [[Chuck E. Live Stage (Dance Floor)|Dance Floor]] and Video Wall. They also remodeled the Phase 3 logo on the roof in the back which was there from when they remodeled to Phase 3, it has also been there since opening. Currently, as of February 2023, they still have the 2.0 remodel and 2021 model Dance Floor + Video Wall.
