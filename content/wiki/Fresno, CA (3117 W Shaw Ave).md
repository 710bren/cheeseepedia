###  Avenger Era ### 
Sometime around 2006-2007, Fresno on West Shaw remodeled to the 2005 Remodel, removing the Showroom Walls, Balcony Seating, and a new exterior. It is unknown of Fresno on West Shaw ever had the Cool Chuck outfit.

It's Unknown when Fresno on West Shaw got the Avenger outfit. Chuck's cap was removed in 2013.

###  Present Day ###
