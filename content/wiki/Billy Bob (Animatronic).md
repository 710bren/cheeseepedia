The Billy Bob Animatronic was one of the main [Rock-afire Explosion]({{< ref "wiki/Classic Stage.md" >}}) animatronics produced by Creative Engineering Inc. The animatronic would first be developed in April of 1980, before debuting at the [Jacksonville, FL (9820 Atlantic Blvd)]({{< ref "wiki/Jacksonville, FL (9820 Atlantic Blvd).md" >}}) on August 14th of that year.

## History ##
Billy Bob animatronics would continue to be produced up until 1983. The January batch would be the last used inside Showbiz Pizza restaurants, and would be kept and stored for future openings, while Creative Engineering would continue to produce bots until June. Now with a surplus of bots, these would need to be sold to other family entertainment centers. 

Through the  [Concept Unification]({{< ref "wiki/Concept Unification.md" >}}) process, Billy Bob would be the only character not used during this process, and was ordered to be destroyed for parts.
## Design ##
The bot is a brown bear in yellow and red overalls, holding a guitar whittled out of a log. He has two ears, beige skin, and black claws. A bird nicknamed 'Birthday Bird' sits on the end of his guitar.

### Movements ###
The bot features twenty movements in total. Those being his head, his ears, his eyelids, his eyes, his mouth, his strum hand, his right arm, his foot tap, and a body lean.
