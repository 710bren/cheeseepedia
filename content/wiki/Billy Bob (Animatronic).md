The Billy Bob Animatronic was one of the main  animatronics produced by Creative Engineering Inc. The animatronic would first be developed in April of 1980, before debuting at the [Jacksonville, FL (9820 Atlantic Blvd)]({{< ref "wiki/Jacksonville, FL (9820 Atlantic Blvd).md" >}}) on August 14th of that year.

## History ##
Billy Bob animatronics would continue to be produced up until 1983. The January batch would be the last used inside Showbiz Pizza restaurants, and would be kept and stored for future openings, while Creative Engineering would continue to produce bots until June. Now with a surplus of bots, these would need to be sold to other family entertainment centers.


Throughout 1989 to 1992, the Rock-afire Explosion would become _Munch's Make-Believe Band_, or more commonly known as the [3-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/3-Stage.md" >}}), through [Concept Unification]({{< ref "wiki/Concept Unification.md" >}}). This was a process to rebrand the Rock-afire Characters as their Chuck E. Cheese counterparts due to the expiration of the Rock-afire license for Showbiz Pizza, now Showbiz Pizza Time, Inc. Billy Bob would be the only character not used during this process, and was ordered to be destroyed for parts.
