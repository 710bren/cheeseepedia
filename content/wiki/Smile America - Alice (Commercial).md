## Notes ##

* Features the [1982 Articulated Chuck Walkaround]({{< ref "wiki/1982 Articulated Chuck Walkaround.md" >}}).
* Some scenes from the commercial, like Chuck appearing out the balloons, Howie blowing out the birthday cake, Mr. Munch coming up close to a child and the girl taking apart her pizza, also appeared in print promotional material.
* Harmony Howlette makes a brief cameo in the commercial in animatronic form.
* Donkey Kong and Ms. Pac-Man arcade cabinets can both be seen in the commercial.
* If you look closely at the scene before Chuck winks, the Chuck E. Cheese carousel can be seen.
