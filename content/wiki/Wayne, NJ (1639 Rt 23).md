## History ##
The store opened on April 20th, 1992, and was one of the last Chuck E. Cheese's (Chuck E. Cheese) stores to open with a Road Stage.

### 'The Incident' (July 30, 2022) ###
On July 30th, 2022, an incident occurred where a black girl was ignored by a person in the [Chuck E. Cheese]({{< ref "wiki/Chuck E Cheese.md" >}}) walkaround, this caused a massive outcry over Chuck E. Cheese's being racist, although many defenders, both Chuck E. Cheese fans or casual visitors, defended CEC Entertainment, stating that the walkaround costume's mask, manufactured by Cowan Costumes, has limited visibility. Nonetheless, CEC Entertainment started a diversity training program in August, and David McKillips personally visited Wayne. This is the rumored reason why they got 2.0 early.

### 2.0 (Fall 2022) ###
In the Fall of 2022, the Chuck E. Cheese in Wayne, New Jersey, closed unexpectedly, many people first expected it was closed due to tanking attendance due to the racism incident, but it turned out to be closed due to an extensive 2.0 remodel. The location did reopen as a 2.0, removing the Road Stage in favor of a 2021 Model Dance Floor & Video Wall. To this day, it is still a 2.0 store.
