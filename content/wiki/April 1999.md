**_April 1999**_ (AKA **_Dance Party**_) was a showtape that released April 1999 and ran until August 1999.

This was the last Studio C show to run on Laserdisc. 

## History ##
The North Richland Hills, TX CEC is featured in the first segment. Chuck E. Town was filmed around 3rd St. of downtown Fort Worth and the CEC Home Office. The first Super Jasper skit was filmed at the famous tourist attraction 'Cadillac Ranch' in Amarillo, TX.

### Unused Blue Screen Footage ###
All the Studio C segments would be filmed by Brian Hagan with the Chuck E. animatronic in front of a blue screen. This was done in case blue screen footage was ever needed, but ultimately went unused.<ref></ref> These were filmed on DVCAM tapes. 

On December 23, 2021, all the unused footage would be uploaded to Brian's YouTube channel.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTmxzgjgpmE</ref>

### Digital Audio Masters ###
The showtape's original stereo audio for all the segments and the live show would be preserved onto Digital Audio Tape. On March 4, 2022, Brian Hagan would upload the original DAT recordings to his YouTube channel<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSz9_hQ3ZJ4</ref>, while providing lossless FLACs of the audio to the community.
