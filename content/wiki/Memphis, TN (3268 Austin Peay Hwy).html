Cheese characters, and removing all SPP decor for newer decor. It was originally a franchised-owned store. Like many other ShowBiz Pizza locations, it had a typical SPP layout seen in many other stores across the United States and would eventually receive the 1988 remodel years after it would open.

On September 16, 1996, the store was acquired by Corporate alongside 18 other locations including the other location on [[Memphis, TN (3649 Hickory Hill Rd)|Hickory Hill]].
