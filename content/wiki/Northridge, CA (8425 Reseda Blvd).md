**8425 Reseda Blvd, Northridge, CA 91324** was a Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre that opened in September 1981 (day currently unknown) with a Balcony Stage, which is still open to this day.

This location currently houses a 2-Stage, and has been a notable store in the 2010's, as they have not remodeled since the mid 1990's, and currently are one of the last stores to have the 1993 Remodel.

## Stages ##
Originally when the store opened, they had a Balcony Stage, as all other Pizza Time Theatres had. They would have the Balcony Stage for several years, until the late 80's or early 90's, when they would convert to a C-Stage, they would have it for a very short time, when in 1993, they would convert to a 2-Stage, which is still there as of October 2022. Chuck E.'s ears are very high up on his head, making it look different, he also wears the rare 'Cool Chuck' outfit.
