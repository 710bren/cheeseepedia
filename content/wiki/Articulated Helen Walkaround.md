The articulated Helen walkaround head was created in 1996 by a former CEI employee, Billy Bob Irving. This head was used in three different showtapes, those being:

* August 1996
* April 1997
* August 1997

During these showtapes, the head was often seen paired with the green cheerleader dress. However, in the first segment of the August 1997 show, Helen is seen wearing the 1994 sequin dress.

The head with the green cheer dress was also used in video for the infamous Strike It Up live show. Strike It Upâ€™s video is currently lost, and only a single second of footage exists due to it being in the May 1998 show. 

In addition, the head was used in the notorious CEC movie, _Chuck E. Cheese In The Galaxy 5000_.<ref> https://youtu.be/LvPDKzSaeyg</ref> During the movie, the head is seen paired with the purple cheer dress, purple shoes, and purple bows.

The head was destroyed by corporate between the 2000s-2015.
