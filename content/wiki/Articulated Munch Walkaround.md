The articulated Munch walkaround head was created in 1996 by a former CEI employee, Billy Bob Irving. This head was used in three different showtapes, those being:

* August 1996
* April 1997
* August 1997

During these showtapes, the head was often seen paired with his standard 90’s outfit. However, during an intermission in the August 1997 show, he is seen without clothes other than his green “Lead Of The Band” tie and a black jacket.

In addition, the head was used in the notorious CEC movie, _Chuck E. Cheese In The Galaxy 5000_.<ref> https://youtu.be/LvPDKzSaeyg</ref> During the movie, the head is seen paired with the standard outfit and a yellow hat instead of green.

The head was destroyed by corporate between the 2000s-2015.
