The **_PTT Training Center & Test Kitchen**_ was a set of programs starting in early 1982 at the [San Jose, CA (2445 Fontaine Rd)]({{< ref "wiki/San Jose, CA (2445 Fontaine Rd).md" >}}) location.

The _Training Center_ would be the first place employees could have proper official training, as no training videos, documents, or programs were present at _Pizza Time Theatre_ stores outside of store guidelines and what a store manager would be told when attending the [PTT Management Training Program]({{< ref "wiki/PTT Management Training Program.md" >}}).

The _Test Kitchen_ would be the first food product research lab used by the company. It would be used for new products, evaluating old products, standardizing distribution for stores, and later bringing in franchisee input for regionalization of selected products.

Both programs would work closely with each other due to their relating fields, allowing further assistance and demonstration.
