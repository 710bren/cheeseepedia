Brain-I-Vac's body is composed of a red vacuum cleaner, typewriter. It's handle has a colender with decorations attached to the end of the lip. It also appears to have makeshift earrings attached to the back of the handle. Brain-I-Vac also has a simple smile, with that, googly eyes and arms that would move freely.
