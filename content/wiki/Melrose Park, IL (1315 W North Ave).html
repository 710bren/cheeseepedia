<h2> Stages </h2>
Melrose Park opened with a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Road Stage" >}}">Road Stage</a>. The stage was installed almost on the ground because the ceiling was low. It didn't last long, as it was replaced with a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/2-Stage" >}}">2-Stage</a> by 1994/1995. The stage received minor changes until the 2012 closure. Changes include Pasqually getting a new drum set, Chuck E. receiving the Cool Chuck outfit (later Avenger), Chuck E. getting a new mask by 2008, Helen getting a new mask sometime in the 2000s, Jasper getting a new mask in 2008-2009, and Pasqually getting a new mask in the 2000s.

<h2> History </h2>
Melrose Park opened on September 24, 1991, with the 1988 remodel and a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Road Stage" >}}">Road Stage</a>. Not much is known about Melrose Park from around this time, however, it is known that Melrose received Record Parody Awards in around 1993.
In 1994/1995, Melrose Park received <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Phase 1 (1994)" >}}">Phase 1</a>, and removed the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Road Stage" >}}">Road Stage</a> for a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/2-Stage" >}}">2-Stage</a>. Melrose also received things duch as shelves and other decor around this time. The location received <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Phase 2 (1997)" >}}">Phase 2</a> and <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Phase 3 (2000)" >}}">Phase 3</a> at later dates. Melrose would receive a new exterior sign and awnings between 1995-1998.
In August 2012 (day unknown), the location relocated to Winston Plaza for bigger space, and because how old the building was. The building would remain vacant for a short period until it was finally torn down for an Olive Garden. As of August 2023, Olive Garden sits on the space.
