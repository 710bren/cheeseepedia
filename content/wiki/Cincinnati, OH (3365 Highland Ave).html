<h2> History </h2>
The Highland, Ave Showbiz Pizza Place opened up November 11, 1982 in Cincinnati, OH. the store featured (assumingly) The Show Room, Sports Room, and Arcade games. This store remained unchanged from its opening due to the fact that during December 1985 this store closed. An auction was then held on January 3rd 1986 where 'Kitchen Equipment, Video Games, Children's Rides, Animated Character Stage Show ' It is unknown where anything from the auction ended up going to. After the auction the company <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank%27s_Nursery_%26_Crafts"> Frank's Nursery & Crafts</a> took over the property in early 1987 with them opening up they completely gutted the inside and modified the exterior.
