<h2>History</h2>
Roseville opened on April 22nd, 1991, in the Gratiot Center with the Road Stage (First and only one in Michigan) & the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/SPT 1988 Remodel Program" >}}">1988 Remodel</a> which has the checkers around the store, the Blue and White awnings, and the CU decor. Roseville's first remodel occurred in around 1996 to the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/SPT 1992 Remodel Program" >}}">SPT 1992 Remodel</a> with the removal of elements from the 1988 remodel such as the Blue & White Awnings, some checkers around the store, CU decor for the Record Posters, addition of the neon lights and the conversion of the Road Stage to 2-Stage (Which replaced Helen's mask with a new one at the time). Roseville then remodeled to the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/CEC 2005 Remodel Program" >}}">CEC 2005 Remodel</a> sometime in 2008-2009, which involved the removal of Showroom Walls, Balcony Seating, adding purple walls, removal of all checkers, removal of older decor for newer decor, expansion of the store, and the relocation of the stage. It is unknown of Roseville ever had the Cool Chuck outfit. Roseville then got the Avenger outfit in around 2009-2011. Chuck's cap was removed in September 2013. Then Helen got a new mask sometime in Mid-Late 2017.The CRTs were also replaced with Flatscreen TVs in around 2018; this also involved putting the flatscreen on the stage which involved the TV & fiber optic Chuck E. Cheese sign being switched around (The same was done at <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Stafford, TX (11920 Southwest Fwy)" >}}">Stafford</a> as well). Roseville would remain like this until in August 2021 when they received the 2.0 Remodel, which involved the removal of the 2-Stage for a Dance Floor & Video Wall.
As of March 2023, Roseville still has the 2.0 Remodel and Dance Floor and Video Wall.
