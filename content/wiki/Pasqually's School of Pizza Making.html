<h2> Actors </h2>

* Unknown as Pasqually (Suit)
* Bob West as Pasqually (Voice)

<h2> Instructions </h2>

* Mixing & Bunning the Dough
** Fill the Water Bucket (70*-80* F)
** Measure the Dough (76*-82* F)
*** If dough is more than 82* F, use colder water (70*-72* F)
<b></b> Pasqually suggests using ice cubes to cool down the water.
<b></b>* Melt completely and store it up.
*** If dough is less than 76* F, use warmer water
** Put bucket on the scale
*** 50 lb sack: 23 1/2 lbs water
*** 25 lb sack: 11 3/4 lbs water
*** Scoop out extra water until you get to exactly the right weight.
*** It's easier to take excess water out than to have to add more.
<b></b> Adding more water requires repeating the water temperature step (70*-80* F) again.
** Pour water into the bowl and add one bag of dough into the water.

<h2> Trivia </h2>

* Pasqually's voice interestingly more resembles the voice of Nintendo character 'Mario' more than in any showtape.
