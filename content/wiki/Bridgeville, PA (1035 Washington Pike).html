<h2>History</h2>

<h2>==Opening and Phase 3 (2002-2011)</h2>==
Bridgeville opened in Q4 2002 with a Studio C 2000 and [Phase 3 (2000)]({{< ref "wiki/Phase 3 (2000).md" >}}) in the Chartiers Valley Shopping Center after relocating from the [1025 Washington Pike]({{< ref "wiki/Bridgeville, PA (1025 Washington Pike).md" >}}) location which was a former Pizza Time Theatre that closed with a [2-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/2-Stage.md" >}}). The exterior remained as is (Except the letters getting replaced) until they received the 2.0 Remodel.

<h2>==2005 Remodel (2011-2017)</h2>==
This location received the 2005 Remodel in 2011 which involved removing decor from the Early 2000's, adding bright florescent lights, and adding purple walls.

<h2>==2017 Wall Repainting (2017-2022)</h2>==
In 2017, the walls were repainted the colors of the 2015 Remodel. All 2005 Remodel artwork were kept. It would remain this way until they received 2.0 Remodel.

<h2>==2.0 Remodel (2022-)</h2>==
On September 22nd, 2022 this location began the 2017 2.0 Remodel Program (2.0 Remodel). This would be the first 2021 2.0 Remodel in the Pittsburgh area (As Monroeville had the 2018 Remodel). On October 5th, 2022 the Studio C 2000 was removed. December 15th, 2022 they held their Grand Reopening event. This event had Chuck E., Helen, Munch, and Jasper walkarounds present.
