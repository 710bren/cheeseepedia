**_7970 Lyles Lane, Store #381**_ is a Chuck E. Cheeseâ€™s that opened on August 28th, 2001 with a Studio C 2000 (Studio C 2000, 32m). They received the 2.0 remodel in 2023. It's located in a freestanding building in the Concord Marketplace.

## History ##
Concord opened on August 28th, 2001 in a freestanding building in the Concord Marketplace with a Studio C Beta 32M, this was one of 3 Betas installed in North Carolina (4 in the Carolinas overall) and was one of the 2 32m installations in the state. When the store opened, they had the 1990s Major Remodel with Late 90s'-Early 2000's art pieces. They would remain this way until August 2014 when they remodeled to the 2013 Update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative which involved removing the Showroom Walls, Skytubes, dim lighting, older decor, and painting the walls purple and adding new decor. The store would again remain this way until March 2023 when they received the 2.0 Remodel which involved removing the Studio C Beta for a 2021 model Dance Floor + Video Wall. As of April 2023, they still have this remodel.

##Stages##
