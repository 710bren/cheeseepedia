<b>3-Stage 2002 Diagnostics</b> was released in 2002 to update the previous 1993 diagnostics to appear how most stores did by 2002. Those changes between 1993 and 2002 would be changing Chucks outfit from the Tuxedo to his Cool Chuck attire. Along with that would be Chuck, Helen, Munch, Jasper and Pasqually now having their plastic masks instead of latex.

<h2> Trivia: </h2>

* This Diagnostics video has been reissued several times since 2002. For all 3-Stage DVDs until [Holiday 2006]({{< ref "wiki/Holiday 2006.md" >}}) it was installed onto each showtape. This continued until January 2007 where it was reissued onto DVD. It was then last reissued in 2014 on DVD to replace the DVD cover with Rockstar graphics. The contents have never been modified (outside of the DVD covers) since its original 2002 release.
