**_10 Wall St**_ was a Chuck E. Cheese's in Burlington, Massachusetts. The location opened August 4, 1992 and closed July 16, 2017

## History ##
Burlington opened on August 4th, 1992; almost two months after  & two weeks before Worcester. This was the second 2-Stage installed in the New England region and first in Massachusetts. Unlike many of them at the time, this location had Jasper's banjo, much like Orange, which opened almost 2 months prior & Worcester which opened 2 weeks later. In 1994/1995, They remodeled to , adding the Thumb Chuck exterior they had until closing. In November 2001, Burlington added a Toddler Zone. Then they got rid of the Ball Crawl sometime in 2002. In the summer of the same year, Chuck's Tuxedo & Derby was replaced with the Cool Chuck outfit. In 2004, they replaced the former Side to Side curtains with Up and Down curtains. In Late 2008, Burlington received the 2005 Remodel which removed the showroom wall(s), the balcony seating, painted several walls purple, replaced the dim lighting with brighter florescent supermarket lighting, and replaced the record/album parody posters with posters of kids smiling. But they kept the exterior as is because the plaza owners were strict. In Early 2012, The curtains were removed, Helen got a new mask and wig, and they received 2 new Flat Screen TVs hanging from the ceiling. In Early 2013, the Cool Chuck shorts were replaced with the Avenger Shorts. Chuck's cap was then removed in September of the same year. In Late 2015-Early 2016, the original screen between Chuck E and Helen was replaced with a modern flat screen; then they received the Play Pass later that year. On June 26th, 2017, the store announced that they would close due to leasing issues. Finally on July 16th, 2017, Burlington was permanently closed.
