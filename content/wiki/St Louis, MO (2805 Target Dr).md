In around 1991 or 1992, they would undergo Concept Unification, this was the process used to convert the RAE characters into the Chuck E. Cheese characters. They closed in 2006 for unexpected reasons. They were abandoned for a little bit as when they closed in 2006, they became a shoe store named 'Shoe Warehouse' which failed miserably and closed not long after.
