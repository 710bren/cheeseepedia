**_132 E Lake St**_ was a _ShowBiz Pizza Place_ restaurant located in Bloomingdale, Illinois.



This location opened on April 1st, 1981, and closed in November 1985.



##Significance##
Bloomingdale is significant because even after closure and being turned into a different pizza restaurant in the 80s which has since closed, Bloomingdale's exterior has remained almost exactly the same as it was when it opened as a ShowBiz in 1981.

The interior of the building, although being mostly gutted, still has some walls and rooms that were there during ShowBiz, such as the tech room in the front right corner of the building.
