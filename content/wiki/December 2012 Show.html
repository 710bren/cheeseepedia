<h2> Trivia </h2>

* All songs from this show were newly redubbed for this show to replaced Duncan's voice with Jared's. All of the songs originally came from [Holiday 2002]({{< ref "wiki/Holiday 2002.html" >}}).
** In addition, this is the last holiday show to reuse the songs or segments from Holiday 2002.
* New footage for 'I Heard The Bells' and 'Boars Head Carol' was produced to replace the old footage from 1999 of Chuck and Helen walkaround around New York and the footage of the 1999 Pasqually Puppet singing. Both were replaced with the same footage being of the avenger Era walkarounds walking around downtown Frisco, TX during the holiday season.

* Despite CEC no longer using Duncan's voice for over a year they decided to use 'Dreidel Song' from [Chuck E's Holiday Party 1999]({{< ref "wiki/Chuck E's Holiday Party 1999.html" >}}). The footage was not changed nor was the voice cast.

* Baking with Betty was slightly reeditied to give a VHS scan line effect over any shot with Betty in it. This is because they wouldn't be able to push the footage into 16:9 without cropping out most of the action. 

* 'Play Some Games For The Holidays' is a 30 second ad about downloading the song on their facebook page. Using footage from the commercial.
* None of the Live shows were redubbed yet for Rockstar. This was also the final time Chuck E.'s March would ever be used.
