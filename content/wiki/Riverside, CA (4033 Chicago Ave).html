<b><i>4033 Chicago Ave</b></i> was a <i>Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre</i> that opened in 1981/1982 (date unknown) with a [[Cyberamics Balcony Stage|Balcony Stage]] and closed in April 1996 (day unknown) with either a [1-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/1-Stage.html" >}}) or [Chuck E.'s House Facade]({{< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House Facade.html" >}}).

This is not to be confused with the short-lived [Riverside, CA (10121 Hole Ave)]({{< ref "wiki/Riverside, CA (10121 Hole Ave).html" >}}), which opened around the same time and closed in 1984 (month and day unknown with a [[Cyberamics Balcony Stage|Balcony Stage]].

<h2> Stages </h2>
Riverside at first had a [[Cyberamics Balcony Stage|Balcony Stage]]. Around 1989/1990, it was replaced with a [Chuck E.'s House Facade]({{< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House Facade.html" >}}). It is rumored that it had a [1-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/1-Stage.html" >}}), but this is currently unconfirmed. After closure, their bots were sent to [[Sandy, UT (10535 So. State St)|Sandy, UT]] for their grand opening, and after closure, the bots were used for parts at [[Orem, UT (40 E Center St)|Orem]]. After the 2017 closure of Orem, the fate of the Cyberamics is unknown.

<h2> History </h2>
Riverside opened in 1981/1982 with a [[Cyberamics Balcony Stage|Balcony Stage]] and was in an unnamed shopping center. Unfortunately, info on Riverside in general is scarce. In 1989/1990, the location received the 1988 remodel, removing all PTT decor, added checkers around the store, changed the exterior, and removed the Balcony Stage for [Chuck E.'s House Facade]({{< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House Facade.html" >}}). In 1994, Riverside would be remodeled to the 1992 remodel with Phase 3, possibly removing the C Stage and possibly adding SkyTubes, and Kid Check. This remodel also removed the waving flags and 1988 decor. It is unknown if this location ever received a [1-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/1-Stage.html" >}}). Riverside remained like this until April 1996 (day unknown), when they would close permanently. The building was later split up into multiple businesses, all still reside today.
