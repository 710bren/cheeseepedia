<b><i>4033 Chicago Ave</b></i> was a <i>Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre</i> that opened in 1981/1982 (date unknown) with a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage" >}}">Balcony Stage</a> and closed in April 1996 (day unknown) with either a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/1-Stage" >}}">1-Stage</a> or <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House Facade" >}}">Chuck E.'s House Facade</a>.
This is not to be confused with the short-lived <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Riverside, CA (10121 Hole Ave)" >}}">Riverside, CA (10121 Hole Ave)</a>, which opened around the same time and closed in 1984 (month and day unknown with a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage" >}}">Balcony Stage</a>.
<h2> Stages </h2>
Riverside at first had a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage" >}}">Balcony Stage</a>. Around 1989/1990, it was replaced with a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House Facade" >}}">Chuck E.'s House Facade</a>. It is rumored that it had a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/1-Stage" >}}">1-Stage</a>, but this is currently unconfirmed. After closure, their bots were sent to <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Sandy, UT (10535 So State St)" >}}">Sandy, UT</a> for their grand opening, and after closure, the bots were used for parts at <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Orem, UT (40 E Center St)" >}}">Orem</a>. After the 2017 closure of Orem, the fate of the Cyberamics is unknown.

<h2> History </h2>
Riverside opened in 1981/1982 with a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage" >}}">Balcony Stage</a> and was in an unnamed shopping center. Unfortunately, info on Riverside in general is scarce. In 1989/1990, the location received the 1988 remodel, removing all PTT decor, added checkers around the store, changed the exterior, and removed the Balcony Stage for <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House Facade" >}}">Chuck E.'s House Facade</a>. In 1994, Riverside would be remodeled to the 1992 remodel with Phase 3, possibly removing the C Stage and possibly adding SkyTubes, and Kid Check. This remodel also removed the waving flags and 1988 decor. It is unknown if this location ever received a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/1-Stage" >}}">1-Stage</a>. Riverside remained like this until April 1996 (day unknown), when they would close permanently. The building was later split up into multiple businesses, all still reside today.
