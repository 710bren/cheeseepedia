<b><i>20 Backus Ave, Store #3231</b></i> was a <i>Chuck E. Cheese's</i> that opened on March 1st, 2010 with a Studio C 2000 in the Airport Plaza. This location closed on August 24th, 2013. This store was located right across from the Danbury Fair Mall.

<h2> History </h2>
<h2>= CEC Era (March 2010-August 2013) </h2>=
On March 1st, 2010, a Chuck E. Cheese's would open in the Airport Plaza. This store took the place of a former club, and opened with the 2010 Update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative. This store's stage was a 16M Studio C 2000 show, which wore the Avenger outfit. This store's bot, judging by footage, was in very poor condition, and had a lot of broken features, which the store never fixed.

On August 24th, 2013, the store would be permanently closed, with no warning being given to customers. The reason the store closed so early has many reasons. These include that the store had very poor maintenance, poor customer service, and had very bad reviews from customers. It was also likely that the owner constantly neglected the store, letting things break. The store was vacant then after.
<h2>= Post-CEC Era (August 2013-Present) </h2>=
After the store permanently closed, the bot was sent to [Wilmington, NC (4389 Oleander Dr)]({{< ref "wiki/Wilmington, NC (4389 Oleander Dr).md" >}}), but remained in storage, as the store never ended up using it. The building remained vacant for a year or two, until a Bev-Max opened in the former space. Later on, a SportClips opened in the space. Both remain open to this day.

|This is just a short video of the Studio C Beta in Danbury, Connecticut. As you can see, Danbury's show is in horrible shape. The lights are going crazy, there are tons of air leaks, Chuck's clothes are dirty, etc. I will not be visiting Danbury at all until the show is fixed. Filmed on 7/4/2012.

|This is segment 3 of the September 2011 show at the Studio C Beta in Danbury, Connecticut. As you can see, something is wrong with the show, and the lights seem to go on and off randomly. This store is not run very well, and the show is proof.
