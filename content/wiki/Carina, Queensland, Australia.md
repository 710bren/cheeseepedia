**_1151 Creek Rd**_ was a [_Charlie Cheese's Pizza Playhouse_]({{< ref "wiki/Charlie Cheese's Pizza Playhouse.md" >}}) that opened in 1982 with a [Balcony Stage]({{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage.md" >}}) and closed between 1984 and 1986.

This store was a relocation of the [Surfer's Paradise]({{< ref "wiki/Surfer's Paradise, Queensland, Australia.md" >}}) location and would be the last location to open in Australia.

## Stage ##
Charlie Cheese's would have a standard [Balcony Stage]({{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage.md" >}}) and would have Cyberamic characters likely to have came from the [previous location]({{< ref "wiki/Surfer's Paradise, Queensland, Australia.md" >}}). Because of this it is well to say that this location kept the Madam Oink character until they received the Bandstand Show in-around 1984.

It is also unknown if they've also relocated the Dolli Dimples Cyberamic to this new location.

## History ##
Little is known about this store as opposed to it's [original location in Surfers Paradise]({{< ref "wiki/Surfer's Paradise, Queensland, Australia.md" >}}) other than the location closing due to Pizza Time Theatre's bankruptcy.
