**_8109 E Washington St**_ also known as **_Washington**_ was a Showbiz Pizza Place that opened on June 18, 1982 with a Rock-Afire Explosion, and closed in December 2011 with a 3-Stage.

This location is located in some sort of shopping center near what looks to be a furniture store (turned into a mall then later abandoned). They would receive Concept Unification in 1991 or 1992, and closed in December 20111 due to it being in an abandoned shopping center.
##History##
5501 E 82nd St opened on June 18th, 1982 and had a Rock-Afire Explosion like every other Showbiz. Around 1991 or 1992, they would receive Concept Unification and receive the Concept Unification decor and a new exterior. In around the Mid 1990's, They would receive either [https://chuckepedia.com/wiki/Phase_1_(1994) Phase 1] or [https://chuckepedia.com/wiki/Phase_2_(1997) Phase 2] which added a lot of 1990s decor and assets such as the Record Posters and Colored Chase Lights.  In the late 90's, they received the Phase 3 remodel which got a new exterior and most of the early 90s decor was removed and the late 90's and 2000's decor and SkyTubes were added. They would remain like this until their closure in December 2011 because they were located in an abandoned shopping center and it did not bring enough business. It is unknown what Chuck E. Cheese became after, but it was probably abandoned with the inside being gutted out, used for others things, and abandoned again. As of January 2023, the place is still abandoned in the abandoned shopping center.
##Stages##
Originally when the store opened, they had a Rock-Afire Explosion like every other Showbiz location.

They would still have this stage until their closure in December 2011 due to it being in an abandoned shopping center.
