<p><b><i>3400 Plaza Dr</b></i> was a Showbiz Pizza place that opened on December 6, 1982 and closed in early 1988. There is little to no information about this place except stories from old employees and the online archived record.</p>
<p><h2> History </h2></p>
<p>This location opened on December 6, 1982 as a Showbiz Pizza Place with the Rock Afire Explosion. Since there was not much info on this place at all here is a story I got from an ex employee on Facebook about opening night.  'I was part of the opening crew who were there when it first opened up.  What a fun job though.  Best cool story for me is that I was the very first person to be “Billy Bob”.  Got to ride around on a tailgate to promote the opening…..then come into the restaurant and try to not step on any little kids!' The location closed sometime in 1988 most likely due to Showbiz Pizza Time Inc. closing locations that didn't make enough money. The old building was later turned into a bingo place with many Showbiz remnants left behind.</p>
<p><h2> Post Closure </h2></p>
<p>After this store closed, Major Magic's All Star Pizza Revue took over. Everything in the store remained intact, including the Rock-afire Explosion. It is unknown for how long the show continued to operate under Major Magic's, or if it was ever replaced at all. It is also unknown when Major Magic's closed.</p>
