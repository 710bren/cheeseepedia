The **_Creative Engineering Premium Video Service**_ was a video subscription service started by _Creative Engineering Inc._ on May 15th, 2017, and still runs to this day.

The service allowed subscribers to see behind the scenes content from the main Creative Engineering YouTube channel, usually in longer-form videos with minimal editing. Video length could run from a few minutes to almost an hour, with length between videos going between twice a day, to months apart. As the service grew in subscriptions, the premium content would become the main focus of the channel, leaving public videos to come out far less often than before.

##  Subscription ## 
Users subscribe to the video service by a purchase of a year's worth of videos through the Creative Engineering eBay account.<ref>https://www.ebay.com/itm/153434591769?hash=item23b96a1219:g:OrMAAOSw9fpbVUSw</ref> The subscription is $72.00, being equal to a six dollar a month payment. Once paid, the user is sent an email welcoming them to the service, while also being added to an email list that is automatically sent emails for Premium content. Premium videos would be sent by email as an unlisted link on the Creative Engineering YouTube channel, or sometimes on a burner YouTube channel. The email would also usually contain a message to the subscribers about the video's contents, separate from the description of the video itself. Certain emails were also sent as a way of communicating with the subscribers, unrelated to video contents being published. This would sometimes be the only way Creative Engineering would announce something to fans, making some info only available to the wider community through speaking with Premium subscribers.
