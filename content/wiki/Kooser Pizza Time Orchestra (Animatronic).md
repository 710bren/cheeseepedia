The Kooser Pizza Time Orchestra was an animatronic produced by [Fantasy Forest]({{< ref "wiki/Fantasy Forest.md" >}}) in 1978 for the 2nd Pizza Time Theatre at [San Jose, CA (1371 Kooser Rd)]({{< ref "wiki/San Jose, CA (1371 Kooser Rd).md" >}}).

<h2> History </h2>
The orchestra debuted at the opening of the Kooser Rd location. It had a very similar appearance to [Winchester's orchestra]({{< ref "wiki/Winchester Pizza Time Orchestra (Animatronic).md" >}}), although it was housed on a small shelf between Chuck and Jasper instead of all around the show room. It is unknown if the orchestra remained in use after Kooser had the [balcony stage]({{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage.md" >}}) installed or was replaced with the [Drum Board]({{< ref "wiki/Drum Board (Cyberamic).md" >}}).
