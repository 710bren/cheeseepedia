<b><i>2701 S Chase Ave, Store #842</b></i> is a <i><a href="{{< ref "wiki/Chuck E Cheese's" >}}">Chuck E. Cheese's</a></i> that opened in April 1983 as a <i><a href="{{< ref "wiki/Pizza Time Theatre" >}}">Pizza Time Theatre</a></i> with a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage" >}}">Balcony Stage</a>.
Milwaukee was the third PTT to open in the state. It was one of the select few stores that got the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Cheese E Street" >}}">Cheese E. Street</a> concept and was also the last store to feature it as it was removed more than ten years after the location opened in 1995. Milwaukee is still open today with the 2.0 Remodel.
Strangely, it is located in the corporate headquarters of an unrelated company called UMOS, Inc. which is in the former Kmart that closed in 2003 and originally opened on November 21st, 1971.
<h2>Stages</h2>
Milwaukee opened with the Balcony Stage and featured the Cheese Crawl underneath compared to Mr. Munch’s usual Magic Madhouse. In 1990, Milwaukee received Chuck E.’s House Facade, and in 1994, received a 1-Stage with a turntable, and received a Dance Floor and Video Wall in 2024. Over the years, updates to the show included new masks in 2001 and 2002, and the replacement of Chuck E.’s tuxedo with the Cool Chuck outfit in 2007. In January 2023, the entire head on Helen and Jasper’s masks were swapped for the ones from <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Chicago, IL (1830 W Fullerton Ave)" >}}">Chicago, IL</a> which received 2.0 in August 2022. Milwaukee also had the last Helicopter Light in any store besides the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Chuck E Cheese's Corporate Office" >}}">Corporate Offices</a>.
The stage was removed on August 18th, 2024 when they received the refresh.

<h2> History</h2>
As previously mentioned, Milwaukee was one of the first stores to receive and open Cheese E. Street in their game room. Cheese E. Street was removed by 1995. As for cabaret acts, Milwaukee is known to have had The King. There is currently no info on if Milwaukee ever had any other cabaret acts, or when the lounge itself was removed. Milwaukee later received the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/SPT 1992 Remodel Program" >}}">SPT 1992 Remodel</a>, likely around the same time as the 1-Stage. In 2015, they received the 2015 update to the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/CEC 2005 Remodel Program" >}}">CEC 2005 Remodel</a>. The showroom walls and balcony seating would remain intact.
Milwaukee started the 2.0 remodel on August 18th, 2024 which involved the removal of the 1-Stage and artwork. The showroom walls and balcony seating would remain intact again.
