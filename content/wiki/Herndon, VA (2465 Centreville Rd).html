<p><b><i>2465 Centreville Rd, Store #368</b></i> is a Chuck E. Cheese's that opened on</p>
<p>May 19, 1992, with a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/2-Stage" >}}">2-Stage</a>, and is still open to this day with the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/CEC 2018 20 Remodel Program" >}}">CEC 2018 2.0 Remodel Program</a>.</p>
<p><h2> History </h2></p>
<p>Herndon opened on May 19, 1992. At first, they had a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/2-Stage" >}}">2-Stage</a>. Nothing special is known about it, and stayed up until the location received the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/CEC 2005 Remodel Program" >}}">CEC 2005 Remodel Program</a> in 2005-2007, replacing the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/2-Stage" >}}">2-Stage</a> with a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Studio C Beta" >}}">Studio C Beta</a>. It would remain this way until July 2023, when the location received the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/CEC 2018 20 Remodel Program" >}}">CEC 2018 2.0 Remodel Program</a>, meaning the Studio C was removed for a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Chuck E Live Stage (Dance Floor)" >}}">Chuck E. Live Stage (Dance Floor)</a> + <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Video Wall" >}}">Video Wall</a>. The Avenger Chuck sign remained, but was replaced with a front with a green outfit. The location also received a Trampoline Zone. As of September 2023, Herndon remains like this.</p>
