**_502 W Ben White Blvd, Store #935**_ was a Showbiz Pizza Place/Chuck E. Cheese's which opened on March 24th, 1982 and closed on May 23rd, 2013.

##  Stages ## 
This location originally opened on March 24th, 1982 with the [\2](\1) stage. Not much information is known about it's stage when it was a Showbiz Pizza Place, 

Around 1991/1992, this location underwent [[Concept Unification]], converting the stage into a Munch's Make Believe Band stage. It would undergo a few changes over the years. One of the highlights of this stage which made it unique was that Pasqually's drum had a black background instead of the usual white color.

On May 23rd, 2013, after this store's closure, all 5 of the main bots were sent to the [[San Antonio, TX (6874 Ingram Rd)]] location before the stage was replaced with a Color of Lights stage in 2014.
