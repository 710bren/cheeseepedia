<b><i>502 W Ben White Blvd, Store #935</b></i> was a Showbiz Pizza Place/Chuck E. Cheese's which opened on March 24th, 1982, and closed on May 12th, 2013.

<h2> Stages </h2>
This location originally opened on March 24th, 1982, with the [Rock-afire Explosion]({{< ref "wiki/Classic Stage.md" >}}) stage. Not much information is known about its stage when it was a Showbiz Pizza Place, 

Around 1991/1992, this location underwent [Concept Unification]({{< ref "wiki/Concept Unification.md" >}}), converting the stage into a Munch's Make-Believe Band stage. It would undergo a few changes over the years. One of the highlights of this stage which made it unique was that Pasqually's drum had a black background instead of the usual white color.

On May 12th, 2013, after this store's closure, all 5 of the main bots were sent to the [San Antonio, TX (6874 Ingram Rd)]({{< ref "wiki/San Antonio, TX (6874 Ingram Rd).md" >}}) location before the stage was replaced with a Circle of Lights stage in 2014.

<h2> History </h2>
This location opened on March 24th, 1982, as a Showbiz Pizza Place with the [Rock-afire Explosion]({{< ref "wiki/Classic Stage.md" >}}) stage, like many other Showbiz Pizza Place locations. Little documentations exist of this location during its Showbiz Pizza Place years.

In 1986, Ben White became the very first location to undergo the 1986 SPT Remodel Program.

Around 1991/1992, this store underwent [Concept Unification]({{< ref "wiki/Concept Unification.md" >}}) and was converted into a Chuck E. Cheese, receiving a few remodels over the years.

On May 12th, 2013, this location would close down as they relocated to Austin, TX (9811 S I-35) (9811 S I-35), which opened on May 27th, 2013, with the old location becoming vacant.

Around February 2015, the site of this former location would begin its redevelopment into a home improvement discount store, having its soft opening around late October 2015,<ref>https://communityimpact.com/austin/news/2015/10/21/austin-habitat-for-humanity-restore/</ref> which the building currently remains as today.
