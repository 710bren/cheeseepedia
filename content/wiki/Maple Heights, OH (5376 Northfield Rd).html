<p><h2> History </h2></p>
<p>Maple Heights opened sometime in November 1980 with a Portrait Stage, and was the 19th PTT to open and the first PTT in Ohio. Unfortunately, information on Maple Heights is scarce, and basically no info on Maple Heights can be found anywhere, but there is one video of most likely Maple Heights, showing the exterior, Showroom, & Lounge / Cabaret Room.</p>
<p>The location would close sometime in June 1985 For unknown reasons, but likely because it was underperforming. The location would hold an auction near the same time. After closure, the location was split up into multiple businesses. The Place is currently mostly vacant with almost no PTT remnants left.</p>
