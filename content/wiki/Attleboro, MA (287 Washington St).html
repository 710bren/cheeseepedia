<p><h2>History</h2></p>
<p>Attleboro opened October 4th, 1993, in Marketplace Square (formerly South Attleboro Square), with a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/1-Stage" >}}">1-Stage</a> and an early version of the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Phase 1 (1994)" >}}">Phase I</a> remodel. They later received <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Phase 2 (1997)" >}}">Phase II</a> and <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Phase 3 (2000)" >}}">Phase III</a> at later dates.</p>
<p>In Fall 2006, Attleboro would remodel to the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/CEC 2005 Remodel Program" >}}">CEC 2005 Remodel</a>, which involved removing all 90s decor, removing the showroom walls and balcony seating, added purple walls, changed the exterior, and expanded.</p>
<p>Attleboro began the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/CEC 2018 20 Remodel Program" >}}">2.0 remodel</a> in October 2019, removing the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/1-Stage" >}}">1-Stage</a> for a 2019 model Dance Floor, and their grand reopening was on January 7, 2020.</p>
<p>Around the same time of <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Methuen, MA (90 Pleasant Valley Rd)" >}}">Methuen</a> having half of their Trampoline Zone set up, which was April 20, 2024, Attleboro started installing one in their store. It is the second after Methuen in New England in Massachusetts.</p>
<p><h2>Stages</h2></p>
<p>Attleboro opened with a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/1-Stage" >}}">1-Stage</a>.</p>
