<b><i>287 Washington St, Store #464</b></i> is a <i>Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza</i> that opened on October 4th, 1993, with a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/1-Stage" >}}">1-Stage</a> and is still open today with the 2.0 remodel.
<h2>History</h2>
Attleboro opened October 4th, 1993, in Marketplace Square (formerly South Attleboro Square), with a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/1-Stage" >}}">1-Stage</a> and an early version of the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Phase 1 (1994)" >}}">Phase I</a> remodel. They later received <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Phase 2 (1997)" >}}">Phase II</a> and <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Phase 3 (2000)" >}}">Phase III</a> at later dates.

In Fall 2006, Attleboro would remodel to the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/CEC 2005 Remodel Program" >}}">CEC 2005 Remodel</a>, which involved removing all 90s decor, removing the showroom walls and balcony seating, added purple walls, changed the exterior, and expanded.

Attleboro began the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/CEC 2018 20 Remodel Program" >}}">2.0 remodel</a> in October 2019, removing the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/1-Stage" >}}">1-Stage</a> for a 2019 model Dance Floor, and their grand reopening was on January 7, 2020. 

Around the same time of <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Methuen, MA (90 Pleasant Valley Rd)" >}}">Methuen</a> having half of their Trampoline Zone set up, which was April 20, 2024, Attleboro started installing one in their store. It is the second after Methuen in New England in Massachusetts.
<h2>Stages</h2>
Attleboro opened with a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/1-Stage" >}}">1-Stage</a>.

Around 2003, A sprinkler room, up & down Curtains, and a new kitchen entrance were added. 

Around 2005, the curtains were disabled. 

During the 2005 remodel in Fall 2006, the stage was relocated and rebuilt.

Attleboro was one of the five New England locations that was open after 2006 that did not receive the Cool Chuck outfit. Those other four were <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Warwick, RI (650 Bald Hill Rd)" >}}">Warwick, RI (650 Bald Hill Rd)</a>, <a href="{{< ref "wiki/North Dartmouth, MA (412-418 State Rd)" >}}">North Dartmouth, MA (412-418 State Rd)</a>, <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Waterbury, CT (650 Wolcott St)" >}}">Waterbury, CT (650 Wolcott St)</a>, & <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Newington, CT (3075 Berlin Tpke)" >}}">Newington, CT (3075 Berlin Tpke)</a>.

By 2009, Helen & Pasqually received new masks. 

In September 2013, Chuck's derby was removed, following the tuxedo in 2014, declaring the tuxedo & derby outfit in-store extinct; being replaced with the Avenger outfit with no cap. 

In April 2018, Jasper's mask was replaced with the mask from the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Newington, NH (30 Fox Run Rd)" >}}">Newington, NH</a> location.

In October 2019, Attleboro started 2.0, removing the 1-Stage on November 11, 2019 and installing the 2019 Model Dance Floor. This is the first location in Massachusetts to get 2.0 (Also the first to remove the animatronic show entirely in Massachusetts).
