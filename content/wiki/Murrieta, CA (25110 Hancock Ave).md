<b><i>25110 Hancock Ave, Store #414</b></i> is a Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza that opened on November 1, 1993 with a [1-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/1-Stage.md" >}}) and is still open to this day with the 2.0 remodel. After 2.0, their bots were sent to the [La Mesa]({{< ref "wiki/La Mesa, CA (5500 Grossmont Center Dr).md" >}}) location and used for parts.

<h2> Stages </h2>
At first, they had a 1-Stage show. Nothing special is known about it, and it stayed up until the 2.0 remodel in May 2023. After the remodel, their bots were parted out and sent to La Mesa to be used for parts to repair their bad conditioned 1-stage, went unused.

<h2> History </h2>
Murrieta hosted its grand opening on November 1, 1993 with the 1992 update to the 1986 SPT Remodel Program and the 1-Stage. Murrieta then received [Phase 1]({{< ref "wiki/Phase 1 (1994).md" >}}) in 1994/1995, removing all elements of the 1988 remodel, and changed the exterior to Cool Chuck. They then received [Phase 2]({{< ref "wiki/Phase 2 (1997).md" >}}) and [Phase 3]({{< ref "wiki/Phase 3 (2000).md" >}}) in their respective years. They remained like this until the late 2000s, when they received the 2005 update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative, which involved removing all 90s decor for new decor, removing the showroom walls and balcony seating, changed the exterior again, and replaced the dim lighting with brighter lighting. In May 2023, Murrieta began the 2.0 remodel, removing the 1-Stage for a 2021 model Dance Floor and Video Wall. As of July 2023, the location still remains like this.
