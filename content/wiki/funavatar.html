<b><i>u/funavatar</b></i> was a Reddit account of a CEC corporate employee that divulged internal information and the discussions of CEC Corporate as they were happening, mainly around the developments of the {{< wiki-link "CEC Legacy Locations: >}}. 

<h2>History</h2>
The user was an anonymous account that posted on r/chuckecheese before being discovered in full on October 10, 2024. Users noticed the account's posts being extremely similar to Mark Kupferman's posts (who also began posting to r/chuckecheese around the same time) in writing, subject, and information given, though with the ability to speak their mind more honestly and with more detail through an anonymous account.
