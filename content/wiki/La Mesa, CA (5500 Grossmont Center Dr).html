<p><b><i>5500 Grossmont Center Dr, Store #405</b></i> is a <i>Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza</i> that opened on August 2, 1993 with a 1-Stage, which is still open to this day.</p>
<p>This location is the last location that still says 'Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza' on the building, and the second-to-last to have the text at all, with <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Altoona, PA (3415 Pleasant Valley Blvd)" >}}">Altoona, PA (3415 Pleasant Valley Blvd)</a> having the logo on the sidewalk sign.</p>
<p>This store is possibly a relocation of <a href="{{< ref "wiki/El Cajon, CA (310 Fletcher Pkwy)" >}}">El Cajon, CA (310 Fletcher Pkwy)</a> <i>Pizza Time Theatre</i>, as it was only 10 minutes away from La Mesa's CEC. That store opened in May 1982 with a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage" >}}">Balcony Stage</a> and closed in 1993 (Possibly a few weeks or so before La Mesa's opening) with a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House Facade" >}}">Chuck E.'s House Facade (C-Stage)</a> which was next to Kmart (The building was demolished for Home Depot sometime after Kmart closed in 2004).</p>
<p>With the acquiring and future redevelopment of Grossmont Center (The mall the La Mesa CEC is a part of) by a real estate firm in 2021, the La Mesa store may close by 2025. The sign fell off on November 2022 and was replaced with a reproduced version of the sign very recently.</p>
<p><h2> History</h2></p>
<p>La Mesa opened on August 2, 1993 with the 1988 remodel and a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/1-Stage" >}}">1-Stage</a>. They received <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Phase 1 (1994)" >}}">Phase I</a> not long after in likely 1995/1996. La Mesa stayed like this for many years. Around 2018/2019, some 1993 remodel decor was thrown away and replaced with 2005 remodel artwork, which caused controversy. As of September 2023, La Mesa's stage remained though non-operational. The location will possibly close before 2025.</p>
<p><h2>Stages</h2></p>
<p>La Mesa opened with a 1-Stage, which is still there to this day, but is in very poor condition, with some videos in 2022 show the character cables for Munch, Jasper, and Pasqually being switched.</p>
