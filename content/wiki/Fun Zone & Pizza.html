<h3> Fun Zone & Pizza </h3>
Fun Zone & Pizza was created after Chico Lost it's license to the CEC IP. The location would retrofit its animatronics & replace old CEC Decor with new ones (with some allegedly hidden from public view). The company used a dog, cow, & lion as the mascot costumes placed over the bots. The Location would use dollar store items & frozen pizza instead of corporate items. The wall decor also became generic mascot ones though they kept the salad bar sign.
The only location of Fun Zone & Pizza would be Chico, CA as it would close in late 2011 due to unprofitability.
