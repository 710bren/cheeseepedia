The Dog was a retrofit of Mr. Munch that was located at Fun Zone & Pizza in Chico, CA 966 East Ave 95926. 

In January 2011, The Chuck E. Cheese's in Chico, CA lost its license to run as a CEC, forcing them to change their branding to Fun Zone & Pizza. They converted their Munch's Make Believe Band characters into generic animals, The Dog uses a generic [https://www.shopmascot.com/Animal-Sunny-Dog-Adult-Plush-Mascot-Costume mascot costume], and Mr. Munch's mech

When Fun Zone & Pizza closed in September 2011, the characters were stripped from their cosmetics and removed and sold in a group for $100. It is unknown if anybody purchased them or where they are today.

The mechanism was the same as a cyberamic, the only difference is that the head mechanism was replaced by a tin can. No showtapes were produced, and DirectTV was played on the television screens in the showroom.
