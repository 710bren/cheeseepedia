**_Dog**_ (also known as **_The Dog**_) was a retrofit of [Mr. Munch (Cyberamic)]({{< ref "wiki/Mr Munch (Cyberamic).md" >}}) used at the [Fun Zone & Pizza]({{< ref "wiki/Fun Zone & Pizza.md" >}}) on [Chico, CA (966 East Ave)]({{< ref "wiki/Chico, CA (966 East Ave).md" >}}). The bot was retrofitted after the location lost its license to the CEC IP. 

## History ##

### As Mr. Munch ###
The bot was originally produced somewhere from 1981 to 1982 & was placed at the Pizza Time Theatre on [Chico, CA (966 East Ave)]({{< ref "wiki/Chico, CA (966 East Ave).md" >}}) in July 1982. The bot had standard PTT attire. In 1993, The bot would gain new CEC styled cosmetics when Chico got their [2-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/2-Stage.md" >}}). The bot also replaced its former arm mechanics for new arm mechanics

### As The Dog ###
In January 2011, The Chuck E. Cheese's in [Chico, CA]({{< ref "wiki/Chico, CA (966 East Ave).md" >}}) lost its license to run as a CEC, forcing them to change their branding to Fun Zone & Pizza. They converted their Munch's Make Believe Band characters into generic animals, The Dog uses a generic mascot costume instead of the Munch Cyberamic ones, though they still had the originally Keyboard from their 2-Stage. The bot's head had a tin can either over it or replacing its former one.

When Fun Zone & Pizza closed in September 2011, the characters were stripped from their cosmetics and removed and sold in a group for $100. It is unknown if anybody purchased them or where they are today.
