##  Trivia: ## 

* All songs from this show were redubbed originally in [\2](\1). With them originally coming from [[Holiday 2002]].
* Despite CEC no longer using Duncan's voice for over a year they decided to use 'Dreidel Song' from [[Chuck E's Holiday Party 1999]]. The footage was not changed nor was the voice cast. 
* This was the final showtape with curtains as the programming for the songs hadn't been touched since 2002. But due to the songs being cut apart some songs only have curtain open and some only have curtain close

* This was the final show with [[Cupid Shuffle]] with this show they decided to reedit the footage to remove the avenger walkaround. Despite also putting a song from 1999 as an intermission. You can tell they all worked together on this.
* This was also the final show to use the old 1999 Puppets. While the footage was the same from [[Holiday 2002]] they would no longer be seen in any way after this point. 

* The Timecode part of this show is a clip from Sesame Street with the text **Merry Christmas Michael! Thanks for all that you do.'._

* Baking with Betty was slightly reeditied to give a VHS scan line effect over any shot with Betty in it. This is because they wouldn't be able to push the footage into 16:9 without cropping out most of the action. 

* 'Play Some Games For The Holidays' is a 30 second ad about downloading the song on their facebook page. Using footage from the commercial. 
* 'Chillout 8' features B Roll footage that was eventually used in 'Share The Joy' meaning it's possible Share The Joy was filmed in 2013 with all the footage with the walkaround then put into Holiday 2014. That's why it sticks out like a soar thumb compared to the rest of the show video wise.
