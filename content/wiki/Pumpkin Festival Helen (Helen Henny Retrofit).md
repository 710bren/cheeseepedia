**_Pumpkin Festival Helen**_ is a retrofit of [[Guest Star / Helen Henny (Cyberamic)]] at _Burger Farm & Garden Center_ in Cincinnati, Ohio. (7849 Main St. (RT 32), Cincinnati, OH 45244)

The bot can only be seen when the location has its annual Fall Pumpkin Festival, in which it and other _Pizza Time Theatre_ retrofits will be displayed as props for decoration from the last week of September through the end of October. None of them are hooked up in any way to be movable, with all cylinders and air hoses removed. 

Helen is displayed in the 'Hen House' with the Warblettes, often trading positions each year. They sit on haybales next to a chicken coop. Each have a general farmer theme to their outfits, complimenting the decorations.

## Design## 
Helen is dressed and changed to look like a peasant girl. Her hair might have been removed, but due to the bonnet it is not clear. As for the outfit, Helen now wears a light blue peasant dress plus a bonnet with a sunflower pattern. Finally, her hands are same as the original PTT hands.
