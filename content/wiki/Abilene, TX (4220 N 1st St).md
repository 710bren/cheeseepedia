**_4220 N 1st St**_ was a _Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre_ that opened on November 23, 1981, and closed in 1984 (month and day unknown) with a [Balcony Stage]({{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage.md" >}}).

## History ##
Abilene opened on November 23, 1981, with a [Balcony Stage]({{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage.md" >}}). It was located on the former Kmart Foods space, which closed in 1979/1980. Other than this, there is nothing known about this store at all. The store closed in 1984 (month and day unknown) due to underperformance. The building was left vacant for a long period of time until the mid 2010s, when it was redeveloped.
