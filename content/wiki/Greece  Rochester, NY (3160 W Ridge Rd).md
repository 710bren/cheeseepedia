**_3160 W Ridge Rd**_, was a Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theater that opened on March 15th, 1983 , with a [Balcony Stage]({{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage.md" >}}) and closed in November 1996 (day unknown), as a Chuck E. Cheese's with a [2-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/2-Stage.md" >}}).

This location should not be confused with the Rochester, NY (3130 Ridge Rd) location, which opened on July 5th, 2003 with a [Studio C Beta]({{< ref "wiki/Studio C Beta.md" >}}), and is still open to this day with the 2.0 remodel.
