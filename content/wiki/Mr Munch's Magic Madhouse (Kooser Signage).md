The **_Mr. Munch's Magic Madhouse**_ sign was used at the second Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre on [1371 Kooser Road]({{< ref "wiki/San Jose, CA (1371 Kooser Rd).md" >}}) in the Blossom Hill Shopping Center from December 1978 to an unknown year.

## Production ##
Production of the sign has no data documented on it; however it can be assumed it was painted between October 1978 to December 1978, and was most likely done by an employee. 

## Usage ##
The only known usage of this sign was at the 1371 Kooser Road store in San Jose California, placed above the first and only known walk-in Mr. Munch's Madhouse from December 1978 to an unknown year in the 1980s. 

## Design ##
The first piece of the sign used a black base with a sky-blue colored background, with the newly introduced Mr. Munch character smiling. The second piece of the sign was painted to the right of the Mr. Munch depiction, with the black and yellow text 'Mr. Munch's' in lowercase letters placed above 'MAGIC MADHOUSE' in all uppercase letters. 

### Notes ###

* Most of the paint used on the text would be faded as early as December 1979.
* The depiction of the Mr. Munch character on the sign is one of the earliest known examples of the Mr. Munch figure being used outside of Kooser Mr. Munch (Animatronic) (animatronic form.)
