**_7419 International Dr**_ is a _Showbiz Pizza/Chuck E. Cheese_ that opened on July 22, 1981 as a corporate _ShowBiz Pizza Place_ with a [https://chuckepedia.com/wiki/Classic_Stage Rock-Afire Explosion]. It is located next to a shopping center and across from Universal Studios Florida.
##History##
Orlando opened its doors on July 22nd, 1981 with a Rock-afire Explosion show. It was originally and currently a corporate-owned store. Like many other ShowBiz Pizza locations, it had a typical SPP layout seen in many other stores across the United States and would eventually receive the 1988 remodel years after it would open. Although very little documentation exists back in the ShowBiz days, it can be determined that Orlando was one of several locations to receive an Uncle Klunk show package (and a Santa Claus retrofit package as well) sometime after opening. Like many ShowBiz locations in the late 1980s, Orlando received the Showbiz Pizza Campground upgrade.

In 1991 or 1992, Orlando received Concept Unification which converted the show to Munch's Make Believe Band. In around the Mid-Late 1990's, Orlando received either [https://chuckepedia.com/wiki/Phase_1_(1994) Phase 1] or [https://chuckepedia.com/wiki/Phase_2_(1997) Phase 2] remodel which removed some early 90's decor and added new decor, a change to the exterior, and the addition of SkyTubes. In the early 2000's, Orlando removed their 3-Stage for the Studio C Alpha stage. Orlando remained this way until sometime in 2006-2007 when they received the 2005 Remodel which involved removing the Showroom Walls, balcony Seating, received a new exterior, and also removing some older 90's decor. In September 2021, Orlando received the 2.0 remodel and removed the 3-Stage for the Dance Floor. As of January 2023, they still have the 2.0 remodel and the Dance Floor.
