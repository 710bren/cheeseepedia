<p><h2> History </h2></p>
<p>This place was originally Bullwinkle’s Family Food N’ Fun Restaurant that opened on May 18th, 1984; the restaurant had a Canadian Northwoods Lodge theme with a color palette of brown and blue on the inside, once Chuck E Cheese’s bought the building, they repainted it white with the 1988 Remodel; adding blue & white awnings, neon lights, & checkers around the store. The Chuck E. Cheese would open on August 31st, 1991, as C<i>huck E. Cheese's Pizza</i> with a Road Stage (One of two installed in Canada). Once the place closed in 1994, it was bought once more by a different company now the building still operates as Schank’s Sport and Grill, and one of the Bullwinkle animatronics that survived.</p>
