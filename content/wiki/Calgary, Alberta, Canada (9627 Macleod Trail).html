<b><i>9627 Macleod Trail</b></i> was a <i>Chuck E. Cheese’s Pizza</i> that opened on August 31, 1991, with a Road Stage, which closed sometime in 1994. 

<h2> History </h2>
This place was originally Bullwinkle’s Family Food N’ Fun Restaurant that opened on May 18th, 1984; the restaurant had a Canadian Northwoods Lodge theme with a color palette of brown and blue on the inside, once Chuck E Cheese’s bought the building, they repainted it white with the 1988 Remodel; adding blue & white awnings, neon lights, & checkers around the store. The Chuck E. Cheese would open on August 31st, 1991, as C<i>huck E. Cheese's Pizza</i> with a Road Stage (One of two installed in Canada). Once the place closed in 1994, it was bought once more by a different company now the building still operates as Schank’s Sport and Grill, and one of the Bullwinkle animatronics that survived.

<h2> Stages </h2>
This location opened up on August 31st, 1991, as one of two Road Stages installed in Canada (The other is [Mississauga, Ontario, Canada (4141 Dixie Rd)]({{< ref "wiki/Mississauga, Ontario, Canada (4141 Dixie Rd).md" >}}), which is still operating as of December 2022). This store would remain open for almost 3 years until it closed sometime in 1994. After closure, the stage would be removed and installed at the [2770 32nd Ave]({{< ref "wiki/Calgary, Alberta, Canada (2770 32nd Ave).md" >}}) to replace the store's [Chuck E.'s House]({{< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House.md" >}}) and remained there until its closure in October 2003.
