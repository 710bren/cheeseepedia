<b><i>412-418 State Rd, Store #751</b></i> is a <i>Chuck E. Cheese's</i> location in North Dartmouth, Massachusetts that opened on December 5, 1994; in the Dartmouth Towne Center. This store is currently open with the [CEC 2018 2.0 Remodel Program]({{< ref "wiki/CEC 2018 20 Remodel Program.html" >}}).

<h2>Stages</h2>
In the early 2000s, the original Helen dress, Jasper shirt, and Pasqually apron were replaced. In 2005, the curtains were disabled. In 2010, they switched to the Avenger outfit. In late 2014, Chuck, Helen, and Munch all got new masks. By the end of 2016, Jasper's 90s mask was replaced with the mask from New London, which closed 2 years prior. His shirt was also replaced. In October 2021, Pasqually's 90s mask was taken apart, to reuse all the pieces on Worcester's mask base. Around that timeframe, the 2005 logo on the exterior was replaced with the 2.0 logo. In September 2023, the stage was removed due to the 2.0 remodel. During the dismantling process, the construction crew shook the animatronics back and fourth on the stage until they fell, box cutters were used to destroy the character cosmetics, and the [[Wink (Cyberamic)|Wink]] was dangling by the airlines for sometime until they were cut off, leading the Wink to go down to the floor. Following the show removal, the character cosmetics were trashed and transferred to a landfill. The rest of the show remains that didn't get discarded was transferred to the [Showbiz Pizza Time Distribution Center (Topeka, KS)]({{< ref "wiki/Showbiz Pizza Time Distribution Center (Topeka, KS).html" >}}) for unknown purposes.

North Dartmouth was one of the five New England locations that was open after 2006 that did not receive the Cool Chuck outfit. Those other four were [Warwick, RI (650 Bald Hill Rd)]({{< ref "wiki/Warwick, RI (650 Bald Hill Rd).html" >}}), [Attleboro, MA (287 Washington St)]({{< ref "wiki/Attleboro, MA (287 Washington St).html" >}}), [Waterbury, CT (650 Wolcott St)]({{< ref "wiki/Waterbury, CT (650 Wolcott St).html" >}}), & [Newington, CT (3075 Berlin Tpke)]({{< ref "wiki/Newington, CT (3075 Berlin Tpke).html" >}}). 
<h2> History</h2>
North Dartmouth opened in Dartmouth Towne Center on December 5th, 1994, with the [1-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/1-Stage.html" >}}).  

In 2009, North Dartmouth got the [[CEC 2005 Remodel Program|CEC 2005 Remodel]].

In 2023, the store received the [CEC 2018 2.0 Remodel Program]({{< ref "wiki/CEC 2018 20 Remodel Program.html" >}}).

On May 4th, 2024, North Dartmouth received the Trampoline Zone.
