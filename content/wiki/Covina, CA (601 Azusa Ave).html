<b><i>601 Azusa Ave</b></i> is a <i>Chuck E. Cheese's</i> which opened in August 1980 (day unknown) as a <i>Pizza Time Theatre</i> with a Cyberamics Portrait / Shelf Stage (Portrait Stage), which is still open to this day.

It is known as the second oldest CEC store in the world.
<h2>History</h2>
Covina opened its doors in August 1980 (day unknown) with the Cyberamics Portrait / Shelf Stage (Portrait Stage) show like every other pre-1981 PTT did. It was also originally a franchised location. In 1981 or 1982, they received a minor remodel involving expanding the store, replacing the logo, and removing the Portrait Stage for the [Balcony Stage]({{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage.md" >}}). On October 22nd, 1984, the location was bought by the corporate along with many other locations.

In either 1989 or 1990, Covina received the 1988 remodel removing the older PTT decor, adding newer decor, and removed the Balcony Stage for [Chuck E.'s House Facade]({{< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House Facade.md" >}}).

In 1991 or 1992, Covina received a major remodel, this time changing the logo and road sign to 'Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza', added checkers around the wall, added Blue and White Awnings, and added more decor and removed some older decor. Around 1993 or 1994, the Chuck E.'s House Facade stage was replaced with the [2-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/2-Stage.md" >}}).

Around 1997 or 1998, Covina would receive the [Phase 2]({{< ref "wiki/Phase 2 (1997).md" >}}) remodel which removed all older 90's decor, added newer decor, and added SkyTubes.

In 2006-2007, Covina received the 2005 remodel removing older decor, removing the Showroom Walls, Balcony Seating, and relocating the stage.

The location also had the last helicopter lights but were removed in August 2022. The Chuck Cyberamic was close to not working but moved a little bit in July 2023. 

In the summer of 2023, the stage was stuck in random mode. This was likely due to a technical error with the Navori system that affected other locations. The location would remain like this until getting the 2.0 remodel. 

In December 2023, Covina received the CEC 2018 2.0 Remodel Program (2.0 Remodel), and had removed its 2-Stage in favor for a Chuck E. Live Stage (Dance Floor) (Dance Floor) + [Video Wall]({{< ref "wiki/Video Wall.md" >}}).
