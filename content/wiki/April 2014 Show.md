##Trivia:##

*This is the final showtape to have segments in between songs.
*This is the final showtape to be created with the puppets being used only between songs for Studio C
* The backdrop for the Studio C puppets in the first two segments are the Studio C curtains (likely from Dept. 18's stage). The backdrops for the latter two segments are the same from Fall 2013 Show (Fall 2013) due to the footage being reused.
* Show Break 1 reuses the footage from 'New Shoes' even keeping the Avenger logo towards the end.
* The footage for 'Everybody Have Fun Tonight' was edited to remove the Avenger walkaround except for a few shots where his back is turned to the camera.
* In 'Everybody Have Fun Tonight' Jaret's voice was recorded over Duncan's voice so you can hear the backing of Duncan's voice during the song, It's most noticeable during the bridge & final chorus.
* Marvin the Technology Guru - Beards is now an intermissions for all stages whereas it was programmed as part of segment 4 for the Studio C/Wedegi version of Fall 2013.
* This is the 4th time a cover of 'Everybody Have Fun Tonight' has appeared in a showtape following CEC Personal Favorites Showtape (CEC Personal Favorites), [CEC Dance]({{< ref "wiki/CEC Dance Showtape.md" >}}), & [April 2012]({{< ref "wiki/April 2012 Show.md" >}}) making it one of the only songs to appear in 3 different vocal eras of CEC & to have 4 different covers based on the showtape being played.
* 'Final Countdown' removes the dialogue during the drum solo.
* The instrumental for 'Back in Time' is from [September 2007]({{< ref "wiki/September 2007 Show.md" >}}) 
* At the end of April 2014 footage shows the end of a 1988' Training tape created by Showbiz Pizza Time, Inc.
* The Live Show countdown for this show is the Cyberstar countdown from the 80s.
