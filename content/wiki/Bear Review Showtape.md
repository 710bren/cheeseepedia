The **_Bear Review**_ Showtape was the last showtape sent out at _Creative Engineering_ before its hiatus on show content that lasted to 2006, made for a modified Rock-afire Mini stage at Okefenokee Swamp Park.

## Summary ##
Rather than the usual names of the [Mini Stage]({{< ref "wiki/Mini Stage.md" >}}) cast, the characters are given unique ones except for Billy Bob:

* Looney Bird - Clem
* Mitzi Mozzarella - Peaches
* Fatz Geronimo - Whitmer

None of the showtape songs were edited to fix character names, so characters are still referred to their original names outside of the intro segments.
During the intro skits exclusive to the tape, the characters comment on the Okefenokee Swamp Park and its attractions, giving guests times for them alongside tips for attending. These intros immediately transition to a selection of previously recorded songs with no mention or buildup to what will be performed.<tabber>
