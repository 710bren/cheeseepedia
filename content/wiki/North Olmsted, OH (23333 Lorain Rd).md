In December 1991, Marc Glassman, owner of the Marc's grocery chain, purchased the Olmsted Pizza Time Theatre when the franchise owner left the area, and the store was converted to Marc's Funtime Pizza Palace.

Like the other Marc's locations, Mentor location would keep the existing stage, but convert the characters into Marc, Rita, Ally, Fletch, and Chops. The date of North Olmsted's closure is unknown.
