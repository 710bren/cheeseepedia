## History## 
Sun Valley opened in July 1992 as a corporate-owned location. Sun Valley opened with the 1988 Remodel including the CU decor, the Blue and White awnings, the checkers around the store, and the Road Stage. Around the mid-late 1990's, Sun Valley replaced their logo with Coach Chuck and removed older 90's decor for newer decor, the Blue and White awnings, some of the checkers, and the removal of the ball pit for SkyTubes. In 2013, Sun Valley remodeled to the 2005 remodel which involved the removal of the showroom walls, removing older decor for newer decor, new booths, relocating the stage, & adding purple walls. Sun Valley still remains like this. Currently, as of February 2023, the location still has the 2005 Remodel and the Road Stage.
## Stages## 
Like all Road Stages at the time, Chuck wore his Tuxedo & Derby outfit. Up and Down curtains were added by the Late 90's. In the Early 2000's, this was replaced with the Cool Chuck outfit. By the Late 2000's, Chuck's outfit was replaced with the Avenger outfit.

As of February 2023, Sun Valley still has the Road Stage and 2005 Remodel.
