<b><i>RetroMation</i></b> (formerly Rock-afire Remake) is a fanmade mod of {{< wiki-link "Rock-afire Replay" >}} that started in January of 2021 which gained official support by Creative Engineering in 2024 to release, alongside CEI using the program for various official showtapes until {{< wiki-link "The Rock-afire Simulator" >}} releases.<sup>(1)(5)</sup>
<br>
The mod also has a build containing Chuck E. Cheese characters, which began passing around in private after the Cease & Desist of Reel to Real as to try to not be noticed and stopped as well, despite many public videos of this build in action being uploaded to YouTube since 2022.<sup>(2)(3)(4)</sup>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Beginnings</h3>
The mod would begin development shortly after the cancellation of Rock-afire Replay, on January 6th, 2021. It would start out as a nonfunctional rip of the models from Rock-afire Replay, and stay that way until November 28th, 2021.

<h3>Name Change</h3>
On January 30th, 2022, Galla would make the decision to rename Rock-afire Remake to RetroMation, a combination of the words "Retro" and "Animation", as he felt it was a more fitting name for a mod that planned to have more than Creative Engineering content. This name has no connection to the Youtuber "Retromation". Another name, "Retronimation" was also proposed by another team member, as it more closely resembled "Electronimation", this name would go unused.
