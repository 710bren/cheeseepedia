**_Guatemala City, Guatemala (Ave La Reforma 7-62, Zona 9)**_ was a franchised _ShowBiz Pizza Place_ that opened in 1986 and closing in 1996 a _Chuck E. Cheese's._

Prior to [Concept Unification]({{< ref "wiki/Concept Unification.md" >}}), the location was not officially acknowledged by [Showbiz Pizza Time, Inc.]({{< ref "wiki/ShowBiz Pizza Place.md" >}}) during its early years of operation. However, unlike other international ShowBiz stores, Guatemala City may have been the only location outside the United States to be converted into a Chuck E. Cheese's.

## History ##
This Showbiz in particular had unique menu items, such as pizzamoffin, pizzpan, and pancakes.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLh73in3pz8</ref>

Prior to its relocation it was remodeled to fit 1986 SPT Remodel Program (Showbiz Pizza Time's current appearance).

The location would relocate to [Blvd Liberación 6-31]({{< ref "wiki/Guatemala City, Guatemala (Blvd Liberación 6-31, Zona 9).md" >}}) in 1996.

## Stages ##
This location's [Rock-afire Explosion]({{< ref "wiki/Classic Stage.md" >}}) show was originally from the Terre Haute, IN (3820 S US Hwy 41) location, which had just closed about year prior. The show more than likely received Concept Unification prior to 1996.
