The **_Mopsey Sisters Nameplate**_ made its first and only appearance at the second Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre on 1371 Kooser Road in San Jose, California; where it took the role of identifying the Mopsey Sisters animatronic.

##  Production ## 
Production on the Mopsey Sisters nameplate was most likely done shortly before, or after the production of the other nameplates featured at the 1371 Kooser Road store, between January to November 1978. 2 instances of a Mopsey Sisters nameplate are known, one featured in store and another in a 1979 Franchise Promotional Brochure. ￼

##  Usage/Releases ## 
The only official usage of the sign was at 1371 Kooser Road, placed on the Mopsey Sisters barrel, first made known of by the October 1979 issue of Food Service Marketing newspaper. <ref>ptt_79fsm.pdf (showbizpizza.com)</ref>

####  Other Known Nameplate #### 
One other nameplate is known to exist, which is featured in an image of the Mopsey Sisters potentially in the Pizza Time Theatre Corporate Office, which the same image is also seen in the 1979 Pizza Time Theatre franchise brochure, most likely meaning it was used for marketing.


##  Design ## 
Similarly to all other Kooser nameplates from the time period, this specific nameplate features a black base featuring 'MOPSEY SISTERS' in orange text surrounded by a border of the same color. ￼


On the other hand, the nameplate used in marketing followed a format more similar to Winchesters nameplate; featuring on a rounded wooden board in white text, 'MOPSEY SISTERS' with '© PIZZA TIME THEATRE INC. 1978' right below, encased in a white border.
