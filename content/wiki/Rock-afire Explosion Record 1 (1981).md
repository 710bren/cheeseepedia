<h2> Birthday Promotion </h2>
Alongside being able to purchase Record 1 at the gift shop, all birthday parties allowed the birthday kid to choose either this record or Rock-afire Explosion Record 3 (1981) (Rock-afire Explosion Record 3) to take a birthday song home with them. To compensate for this, both records were produced at 10x quantity, alongside birthdays bumping from $3.50 per person to $3.65 upon a restaurant receiving their first batch.
