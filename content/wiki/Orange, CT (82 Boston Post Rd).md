## History ##
Orange opened June 16, 1992 in the Edwards Plaza Shopping Center with the . The location originally featured a 2-Stage. Unlike many of them at the time, this location had Jasper's banjo, much like Burlington & Worcester around 1-2 months later. This was the first location in New England to receive the 2-Stage. Orange would receive their first remodel in the Mid 1990's which involved removing the checkers around the store, Blue and White Awnings, and Neon Signage. They also replaced the Banjo with the Flying Cheese Guitar wound this time as well. Orange would then receive the  in Summer 2006 which involved the removal of the 2-Stage, Balcony Seating, & 1990's Decor. This involves the installation of their Studio C Beta (One of two in New England that replaced an existing stage, the other being  which was a former Pizza Time Theatre, was also a 16m as well) with the Cool Chuck outfit. That involved swapping places with one of the gamerooms. In around the Late 2000's-Early 2010's, they removed the Dinner Lights, Sign above the Kid Check, & add bright florescent lighting. Chuck's Cool Chuck outfit was also replaced with the Avenger outfit around that time. On May 19, 2013, Orange became the last Studio C stage in Connecticut after the closure of [Meriden, CT (533 S Broad St)]({{< ref "wiki/Meriden, CT (533 S Broad St).md" >}}) due to leasing issues. Later in the year, Chuck's cap was removed. In around 2017-2019, Chuck's Avenger outfit was replaced with Rockstar. In 2020, the Skytubes were removed due to COVID-19. In October 2021, Orange started their 2.0 Remodel which involved a major expansion (Which involved relocating the showroom to the new area of the store. Also, according to a cast member, there were talks about expanding the store dating all the way back to 2015-2016). On March 23, 2022, the Studio C Beta was removed for a Dance Floor & Video Wall. Orange had their Grand Opening on May 8th, 2022, with the remodel being complete 3 days later.
