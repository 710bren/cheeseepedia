<h2>= Unconfirmed Stores </h2>=
Two stores had some sort of Klunk part discovered at their location. Springfield with Klunk valves, and Davenport with a Klunk arm. This confirms Klunk was present at their store at some point, but it is unknown which event(s) he was used in. Davenport does mention potentially receiving a Klunk for 1983 however.<ref name=':0'>https://www.newspapers.com/image/665684553/?clipping_id=55395460&fcfToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJmcmVlLXZpZXctaWQiOjY2NTY4NDU1MywiaWF0IjoxNjk2OTcwNDk0LCJleHAiOjE2OTcwNTY4OTR9.sClG1OZrf2KnRIxRDXP7BAdtVpv1p4YKdgIgIRQHA4Q</ref>

* [Springfield, OH (2345 Valley Loop Rd)]({{< ref "wiki/Springfield, OH (2345 Valley Loop Rd).html" >}})<ref>Store had Klunk Valves under the stage.</ref>
* [Davenport, IA (903 E Kimberly Rd)]({{< ref "wiki/Davenport, IA (903 E Kimberly Rd).html" >}})<ref>https://www.newspapers.com/article/quad-city-times/56630231/</ref><ref name=':0' />
The Farmington Hills, MI (29955 Orchard Lake Rd) store also could have had Klunk either for this event or [[The Amazing Uncle Klunk Traveling Show (Event)|The Amazing Uncle Klunk Traveling Show]] before its closing, due to [Chicago, IL (5030 S Kedzie Ave)]({{< ref "wiki/Chicago, IL (5030 S Kedzie Ave).html" >}}) having a Klunk. Farmington transferred all their animatronics to Kedzie for them to open with in November of 1984, meaning a Klunk could have potentially been one of them.
