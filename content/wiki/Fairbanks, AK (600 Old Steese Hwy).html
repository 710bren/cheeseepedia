<p><h2> History </h2></p>
<p>Fairbanks opened in January 1986 (day unknown) with a Balcony Stage. This would be the last CEC location opened for a while, as they wouldn't open another location until 1987. However, only 3 videos are confirmed to be from this location, and they show a good majority of the store. But in 1988 (month and day unknown), the location closed forever for unknown reasons, but it was likely in a bad area. After closure, it became a car dealership named Gene's, which closed by 2009. After closure, it became a church, only for it to close. As of July 2023, the building remains vacant once again. It is unknown if the building is going to be demolished.</p>
