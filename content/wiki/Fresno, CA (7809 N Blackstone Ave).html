<b><i>7809 N Blackstone Ave, Store #364</b></i> is a Chuck E. Cheese's in Fresno, California. The store is located in a freestanding building in the Villaggio Shopping Center.

This is not to be confused with the <i>Pizza Time Theatre</i> on [[Fresno, CA (5384 N Blackstone Ave)|5384 N Blackstone Ave]] which opened in July/August 1980 and closed in May 1985 with a [[Cyberamics Portrait / Shelf Stage|Portrait Stage]] which was in an unnamed Shopping Center 9 minutes away.

<h2> History </h2>
Fresno (Blackstone) opened on September 24th, 2002 in a freestanding building in the Villaggio Shopping Center with a [[Studio C 2000|Studio C 2000, 32m]]. They opened with the 1990s Major Remodel with the [[Phase 3 (2000)|Phase 3]] game package. The store would remain this way until around 2013/2014 when they would remodel to the 2013 update of the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative which involved the removal of the 1990s Decor, Must C TV posters, and dim lighting, adding purple walls, bright florescent lighting. In February 2024, they received the 2.0 Remodel, which included a Video Wall, Interactive Dance Floor, repainting of all walls to white, new 2.0 Artwork, the 2.0 Game Package, and an exterior remodel.
