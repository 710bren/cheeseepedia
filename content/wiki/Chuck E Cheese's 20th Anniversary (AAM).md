The **_Chuck E Cheese's 20th Anniversary Show (AAM Version)**_ was a modified version of the [Chuck E Cheese's 20th Anniversary]({{< ref "wiki/Chuck E Cheese's 20th Anniversary.md" >}}) fit specifically for the [Awesome Adventure Machine]({{< ref "wiki/Awesome Adventure Machine.md" >}}) stage, releasing April 1st, 1997.

## Archive Recording ##
_Brian Hagan_, programmer for the showtape and later Studio Manager of CEC Entertainment, would record the show's major segments as an archival recording of the stage, being the only footage known of the [Awesome Adventure Machine]({{< ref "wiki/Awesome Adventure Machine.md" >}}). The footage would be recorded on a Sony Hi8 camcorder with the video fed to a Sony Betacam SP video recorder. The audio was recorded directly to the Betacam SP deck from the Laserdisc source, making it the only known copy of the original audio- as Brian recounts all AAM showtape discs being thrown out.<ref>https://youtu.be/3ynDO4UGEqk</ref>
