<h2>Trivia:</h2> 

*This is the first show to feature the 'Ladies & Gentlemen It's Showtime!' intro. The intro was programmed for the next and subsequent showtapes, and is based on the  '[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live Saturday Night Live]' intro,
*The start of Segment 1 references the song 'Party Place', originally from [Chuck E's Rockin' Rhymes]({{< ref "wiki/Chuck E's Rockin' Rhymes.html" >}})
*Clips of the footage shot for 'Baby' were eventually reused in 2017 for various 40 Years of Fun promotional videos.
**”Dancin In The Sun”,”On The Bright Side” were written by Dave Wilson for this show.
