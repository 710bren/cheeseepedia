The <b><i>Artie Antlers [Cyberamics]({{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics.md" >}})</b></i> were a set of retrofitted animatronics created by [Pizza Time Theatre]({{< ref "wiki/Pizza Time Theatre.md" >}}) in the early 80's for the Cabaret. This animatronic first premiered at the [Sacramento (Florin Mall), CA (7020 Stockton Blvd)]({{< ref "wiki/Sacramento (Florin Mall), CA (7020 Stockton Blvd).md" >}}) in 1980. He was the second cabaret act that [Pizza Time Theatre]({{< ref "wiki/Pizza Time Theatre.md" >}}) introduced, replacing [Dolli Dimples]({{< ref "wiki/Dolli Dimples (Cabaret).md" >}}).

<h2> Movements </h2>
Artie Antlers likely featured the same movements as the other cabaret characters, but removed Dolli Dimples' bosom mechanism.
