**_221 South Dr, Store #482**_ was a _Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza/Chuck E. Cheese's_ in Paramus, New Jersey. It was located in a small plaza across from the Bergen Town Center.

The store would be relocated to [Paramus, NJ (275 Route 4 West)]({{< ref "wiki/Paramus, NJ (275 Route 4 West).md" >}}) which opened on December 26th, 2011 with a Studio C Beta, 16m and still operates to this day.

##History##

###Pre CEC (1958-1993)###
The Plaza where the Paramus (221 South Dr) location was located was built sometime in 1958<ref>http://wikimapia.org/14661916/Chuck-E-Cheese-s</ref>. It is unknown how many tenants occupied the building but the last tenant was closed by the end of 1992 with construction starting sometime afterwards.

###CEC (October 1993-November 2010)###
The Paramus (221 South Dr) location would open on October 18th, 1993 in a plaza across the street from the Bergen Town Center with their 1-Stage and the 1993 update to the 1994 SPT Repositioning / Remodel Program. The store would remain this until around 1997-1999 when the store would receive [Phase 2]({{< ref "wiki/Phase 2 (1997).md" >}}) which involved replacing Exterior Signage (Changing it from 'Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza' to 'Chuck E. Cheese's'), replacing the awnings, repainting the building, and possibly a minor interior remodel. The store would remain this way until it's closure in November 2010.

###Post CEC (2010-Present)###
After the store's closure, the plaza the location was housed in would be demolished to make way for a new development. By 2012, A building housing REI, Red Robin (which was formerly another restaurant) (Now Closed), & Kirkland's (Now Closed). As of March 2023, this building is still there.

##Stages##
When Paramus (221 South Dr) opened, the store housed a 1-Stage (One of six installed in the state of New Jersey). Chuck E. wore his Tuxedo & Derby hat like all other 1-Stages when it was first installed. In around the Early-Mid 2000's Chuck's Tuxedo & Derby Outfit would be replaced by the Cool Chuck outfit. It would remain this way until the stage's removal when the store closed permanently in November 2010.
