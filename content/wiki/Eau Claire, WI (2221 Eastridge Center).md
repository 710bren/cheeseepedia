**2221 Eastridge Center** was a Chuck E. Cheese's location that opened on April 30th, 1987 in the Eastridge Shopping Center. They closed in 1989 at an unknown date, after two years in operation. This makes this location the shortest-lived Chuck E. Cheese's ever opened. After they closed they became a Circus Pizza for a short-lived period until they also closed at an unknown date.

This store is notable for being the first location to open with a final version of [Chuck E.'s House]({{< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House.md" >}}){< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House.md" >}}){< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House.md" >}}){< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House.md" >}}), also known as the Rocker Stage. They were the second overall, counting the early version at the [Arlington, TX (2216 S Fielder Rd)]({{< ref "wiki/Arlington, TX (2216 S Fielder Rd).md" >}}) store. They were also likely the first location to close with a Rocker Stage, having never replaced theirs.
##History##
Eau Claire opened on April 30th, 1987 in the Eastridge Center, being one of the earliest modern Chuck E. Cheese's locations, being the fifth overall. This location housed the second [Chuck E.'s House]({{< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House.md" >}}){< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House.md" >}}){< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House.md" >}}), and the first final version. This location was short-lived, closing in late 1989, two years after opening. This would make it the shortest lived Chuck E. Cheese's ever, beating [Danbury, CT (20 Backus Ave)]({{< ref "wiki/Danbury, CT (20 Backus Ave).md" >}}) by one year. No images exist or are known to exist of Eau Claire anywhere, and no videos have surfaced either, due to this location's short lifespan.

## Post Closure ##
After they closed in 1989, they would become a Circus Pizza restaurant, possibly getting a  installed at the location. This location closed at an unknown date, possibly 1999, as that was when Circus Pizza sold all of their locations, most becoming Chuck E. Cheese's. This wasn't the case for Eau Claire, however and the store was closed. The building it was housed in is now a Highland Fitness, with most, if not all remnants removed.

## Stages ##
This store had the first final [Chuck E.'s House]({{< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House.md" >}}){< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House.md" >}}) and the second overall, and would keep it until closure.
