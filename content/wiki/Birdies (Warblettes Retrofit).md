## History ##
_The Birdies_ were installed in the 1995 expansion to Jungle Jim's International Market. They were originally from the [Cincinnati, OH (11400 Princeton Pike)]({{< ref "wiki/Cincinnati, OH (11400 Princeton Pike).md" >}}) Pizza Time Theatre and were bought in an auction. They were located in the Pet-Land section which is now today an expansion for the _international foods_. The stage was originally a bird house which was positioned over an aisle. The Birdies looked identical to how they looked during their PTT Days. From September 1995 - June 2021 the Birdies were untouched with the occasional maintenance being done. The bots have been at [https://lifeformations.com/#gref LifeFormations] since June 2021 and were shipped back to Jungle Jim's in January 2022. They are current awaiting reinstallation in the new pet section located at the front of the grocery store.
