[\2](\1)
**Kooser Mr. Munch** was the first iteration of Mr. Munch used at the opening of the [\2](\1) Pizza Time Theatre in December 1978. He was replaced by the standard Cyberamic design in May 1980 after the Portrait Show was replaced by the [\2](\1).

##  Design ## 
Mr. Munch was placed behind two closed doors, the same way Pasqually was, and would pop out when it was his time to speak in a show. 

Munch was a very thin animatronic with thick purple and yellow fur. He had the same metal eyelids used by the other Kooser animatronics. \

##  Fate ## 
After Kooser upgraded to the Balcony show, Munch's whereabouts were unknown. It's assumed he was moved to [\2](\1), but unlike [\2](\1), there are no pictures of him at Sunnyvale. He is currently presumed to have been destroyed when Sunnyvale relocated to [\2](\1) after PTT's bankruptcy.,
