[[File:Kooser munch.png|thumb]]
**Kooser Mr. Munch** was the first iteration of Mr. Munch used at the opening of the [San Jose, CA (1371 Kooser Road)]({{< ref "wiki/San Jose, CA (1371 Kooser Rd).md" >}}) Pizza Time Theatre in December 1978. He was replaced by the standard Cyberamic design in May 1980 after the Portrait Show was replaced by the [Balcony Show]({{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage.md" >}}).

## Design ##
Mr. Munch was placed behind two closed doors, the same way Pasqually was, and would pop out when it was his time to speak in a show. 

Munch was a very thin animatronic with thick purple and yellow fur. He had the same metal eyelids used by the other Kooser animatronics. \

## Fate ##
After Kooser upgraded to the Balcony show, Munch's whereabouts were unknown. It's assumed he was moved to [Sunnyvale]({{< ref "wiki/Pizza Time Theatre Sunnyvale, CA Corporate Office.md" >}}), but unlike Kooser Chuck E. Cheese (Animatronic) (Chuck E), there are no pictures of him at Sunnyvale. He is currently presumed to have been destroyed when Sunnyvale relocated to [Texas]({{< ref "wiki/Showbiz Pizza Time Corporate Office.md" >}}) after PTT's bankruptcy.,
