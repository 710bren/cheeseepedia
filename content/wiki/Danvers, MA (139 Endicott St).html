<p><b><i>Danvers, MA (139 Endicott St, Store #478)</b></i>, was a <i><a href="{{< ref "wiki/Pizza Time Theatre" >}}">Pizza Time Theatre</a></i> store that opened on April 24, 1983, as a franchised store, and closed April 15th, 2020 as a corporate location.</p>
<p>This location would be notorious in the early 2000's for contributions to the location itself by former employees Jenn Waitt, and her friend Jay Hubbard, and also had a largely documented history throughout its 37-year run, before its eventual closure.</p>
<p><h2> History </h2></p>
<p>Danvers opened in April 24th, 1983, in Endicott Plaza, franchised by Tom Saltsman's Pizza Time Partners Ltd<sup>[1]</sup>. Danvers was one of the first locations to utilize <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Cheese E Street" >}}">Cheese E. Street</a>. On February 2nd, 1987, Danvers was bought by corporate. In Summer 1989, the store underwent the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/SPT 1988 Remodel Program" >}}">SPT 1988 Remodel</a>, which also relocated the Cabaret. Cheese E. Street was also removed at this time.</p>
<p>Around 1993 Danvers would get the  <a href="{{< ref "wiki/SPT 1992 Remodel Program" >}}">SPT 1992 Remodel</a>, and a brand-new exterior was built, later getting the Coach Chuck sign a few years later.</p>
<p>In 2001, Danvers would enter a district wide contest, where they would create a Food Preparation Training Video, and won the contest. In May of that year, Danvers would host a 25th anniversary party for Chuck E. Cheese's, decorating the stage, and giving the Chuck E. animatronic his PTT vest as well, Later in the year came the Fourth of July stage decorations in celebration of the holiday. That December, Danvers hosted a Christmas party, decorating the entire store. <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Helen Henny" >}}">Helen Henny</a> and <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Jasper T Jowls" >}}">Jasper T. Jowls</a> would make a special appearance as well, and <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Chuck E's Holiday Party 1999" >}}">Chuck E.'s Holiday Party 1999</a> would play for the event, despite <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Holiday 2002" >}}">Happy Holidays 2002</a> being the current showtape at the time. Danvers would then host Cheesevention in 2004 and 2005, the former event notably having Aaron Fechter as a special guest. Between November 2007-June 2008, Danvers would remodel their store to the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/CEC 2005 Remodel Program" >}}">CEC 2005 Remodel</a>. The exterior was refurbished in April-June. Another Cheesevention was held at the store as well that year. Danvers would largely remain the same after this.</p>
<p>In August 2013, Danvers would host one more Cheesevention, notably being the debut of the Rockstar costume at that store. The Avenger hat was also removed by September.</p>
<p>On April 15th, 2020, in the early weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic, Danvers would close their doors, reason being their lease expired in late 2019, and the store did not or was unable to renew. The store was open for takeout prior to the closure date. A majority of stuff was cleared out through April 29th, and then the store was left abandoned, leaving the exterior intact. Despite this closure, it would not be recognized by many until June, when CEC Entertainment filed for bankruptcy, and it along with other stores closed the past 2 months were listed on articles. The store would remain untouched until March 2021, where some more stuff got cleared out, and finally in June, the interior began to be gutted and remaining stuff would be trashed. The exterior had the awnings removed by July 12th, and the signage was removed July 18th. By August, the exterior finally went down, revealing the original PTT exterior underneath, before it too was demolished. As of December 2021, the store is now MB Spirits, a chain of Market Basket.</p>
<p><h2> Stages </h2></p>
<p>Danvers originally featured the Balcony Stage much like every PTT at this point, with Madame Oink as the guest star. A few months later, <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Helen Henny" >}}">Helen Henny</a> would replace her. In the Cabaret, B.B Bubbles would be their first act, along with <a href="{{< ref "wiki/The King  King Kat (Lounge)" >}}">The King</a>.</p>
<p>In February 1985, Danvers removed their Balcony Stage, which would be sent to <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Fall River, MA (35 Mariano Bishop Blvd)" >}}">Fall River</a> for that store's opening, due to a shortage of <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics" >}}">Cyberamics</a>. In addition, B.B Bubbles took her final bow at the store and was removed. In place of the Balcony Stage was the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Family Album" >}}">Family Album</a>. The names of the characters at the store were <i>Nadine</i> ('Dee-Dee'), <i>Randy</i> (the leader), and <i>Tommy-John</i> (or 'TJ').</p>
<p>In March 1988, Danvers would remove the Family Album, receive a new set of animatronics, build a temporary stage in front of the old Family Album, and begin construction on <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House" >}}">Chuck E.'s House</a>, which was completed in April. In July 1989, The King was removed, to be swapped with The Beach Bowzers from Newington, NH. Chuck E.'s House would remain mostly the same throughout the years, with some cosmetic updates such as a new Jasper shirt in the early 1990s, the Singing Flowers being removed and re-installed multiple times, the windows on Munch and Pasqually's sides removed, and the fake plants being removed.</p>
<p>Around 1993, Danvers would remove Chuck E.'s House, and receive a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/2-Stage" >}}">2-Stage</a>. The characters also had all their PTT masks replaced. The Beach Bowzers was also removed at this time. Around 1999-2000, Jasper's 1992 shirt was replaced. In 2002, Pasqually's 1992 mask was replaced with a mask made in 1999. Helen's 1992 dress was replaced around 2002, Danvers would receive the Cool Chuck outfit around the same time. Jasper's original cheese guitar was also replaced by a 3-Stage cheese guitar by 2004-2005, along with Helen's mask. Curtains were disabled in September 2005, though Chuck's curtains remained operable for live appearances. By 2011, they replaced the Cool Chuck outfit with the Avenger outfit. The cap was removed in September 2013. In 2018, the original drum front was covered up by the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Ticket Blaster" >}}">Ticket Blaster's</a> decal, and later that year, the curtains were removed. These would be the last changes made to the stage before the store closed its doors.</p>
