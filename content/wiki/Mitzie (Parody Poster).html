<p>The <b><i>Mitzie</b></i> was a poster created for <i>Showbiz Pizza</i> and <i>Chuck E. Cheese's</i> in <i>1988</i>.</p>
<p><h2>Production</h2></p>
<p>This poster was one of the few Rock-Afire Explosion parody posters released in 1988. Once <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Concept Unification" >}}">Concept Unification</a> began this poster would cease production in 1990.</p>
<p>This poster has been re-released by Creative Engineering after Concept Unification after mass fanfare for the Rock-afire Explosion has been ignited in the 2000s.<sup>[1]</sup></p>
<p><h2>Design</h2></p>
<p>The poster is a parody of the 1982 film, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tootsie Toostie], with Mitzi Mozzarella taking on the role of Michael Dorsey.</p>
<p>Much like Billy Bob in <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Beverly Hills Bob (Parody Poster)" >}}">Beverly Hills Bob</a>, Mitzi is also seen in an unusual human-like form, having a more defined body specifically created for this artwork. Specifically looking as if Mitzi's head is superimposed onto the body of the actor pictured in the original, Michael Dorsey.</p>
<p>Mitzi is seen in the same red dress seen in the original movie poster with a hairstyle more similar to the Michael Dorsey character.<sup>[2]</sup> Behind Mtizi is a large American flag, although the stars are interestingly blue as opposed to the standardized white.</p>
