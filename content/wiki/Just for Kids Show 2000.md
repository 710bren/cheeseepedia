## Trivia: ##

* The Studio C Puppets for this show feature white borders around each square for the Studio C Puppets. Helen's is green, Pasqually's is red, Munch is amber, and Jasper is blue.
* This was the final show to feature the Studio C Bluescreen footage. It also seemingly has the Studio C Bluescreen footage leftover from [January 2000]({{< ref "wiki/Chuck E's Variety Show - Best of 1999.md" >}}).
*This was Karisa McKinney's final show as Helen Henny.
