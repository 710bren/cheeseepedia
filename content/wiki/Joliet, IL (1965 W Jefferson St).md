**_1965 W Jefferson St**_ was a _Chuck E. Cheese's_ that opened as a _ShowBiz Pizza Place_ on July 13th, 1983 with a Rock-afire Explosion (Later Munch’s Make Believe Band), which closed in September 2006.


##Stages##
It started as a Rock-afire, then in 1991 or 1992 became a 3-Stage.

###Post Closure###
As for the building itself, after Joliet closed in September 2006, it was left vacant for 15 years. The exterior remained almost the same, with the only changes being it being painted over. As for the interior, it was mostly gutted, but things such as the showroom walls and the Skytubes letters were left inside. In 2021, as part of the redevelopment of the vacant space next to the CEC, Planet Fitness decided to move in. 

As for the show, it was sent to the  store. Mishawaka installed Joliet’s animatronics on their stage, which performed until 2018 when the stage caught fire and was removed.

## Animatronics ##
As previously mentioned, the animatronics from Joliet were sent to Mishawaka, IN. Mishawaka then replaced their original animatronics with Joliet’s, meaning their original animatronics must have been in poor shape and Joliet’s were a lot better. Joliet’s animatronics were in service on Mishawaka’s stage until in 2018, a fire destroyed the stage, forcing Mishawaka to get a dance floor. Joliet’s animatronics then were split between multiple stores such as Darien, IL and Chicago Kedzie IL to be used as parts.
