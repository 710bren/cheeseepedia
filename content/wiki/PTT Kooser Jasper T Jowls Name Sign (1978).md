The **_1978 Kooser Jasper T. Jowls Nameplate**_ appeared at the second Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre on [1371 Kooser Road]({{< ref "wiki/San Jose, CA (1371 Kooser Rd).md" >}}) located in the Blossom Hill Shopping Center in San Jose, California; placed under the Kooser Jasper T. Jowls (Animatronic) (Kooser Jasper T. Jowls) for the purpose of identifying the Jasper T. Jowls character. 

## Production ##
Alongside the other nameplates featured at the store, we can assume it was produced in a batch at the Fantasy Forest Manufacturing Company between October through November 1978, if not it was most likely produced by Pizza Time Theatre Incorporated; due to the significance of the character, it was most likely the second produced nameplate for the location after PTT Kooser Chuck E. Cheese Name Sign (1978) (Chuck E. Cheese's nameplate.) 

## Usage ##
The only usage of the nameplate was used at the 1371 Kooser Road location, placed under the Kooser Jasper T. Jowls (Animatronic) (Kooser Jasper T. Jowls) from as early as November 1978, and lasted to May 1980, where multiple scenarios could have played out after May 1980, those being:


**A.** _The nameplate was placed in one of several storage rooms at the 1371 Kooser Road location and thrown out._

**B.** _The nameplate was placed in one of several storage rooms at the 1371 Kooser Road location and destroyed._

**C.** _The nameplate was sent to the 1213 Innsbruck Drive corporate office in Sunnyvale, California, alongside the Kooser Portrait Animatronics._

## Design ##
Pizza Time Theatre Incorporated most likely ordered Fantasy Forest Manufacturing to design the Kooser batch of nameplates in a brown and yellow color scheme to stick out on the dark wall the portraits were placed on, while also following a style similar to the nameplates seen at [370 South Winchester Boulevard location.]({{< ref "wiki/San Jose, CA (370 S Winchester Blvd).md" >}}) 


Much like all of the other nameplates seen at the 1371 Kooser Road store, Jasper T. Jowls nametag used a rounded brown, woodened base with the text 'Jasper T. Jowls' in yellow text, enclosed in a thin border of the same color, with supporting bolts on both the left and right side of the nameplate.
