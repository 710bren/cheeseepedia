<p><h2>History</h2></p>
<p>Pico Rivera opened sometime in 1982. Unfortunately, there is hardly any information about when it was a PTT, but they had a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage" >}}">Balcony Stage</a>. Pico Rivera had the stage and the store unchanged until the late 80s when they received the 1988 remodel. They removed the Balcony Stage for the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House Facade" >}}">Chuck E.'s House Facade</a> and added new decor. They would remain like this until their second remodel in the mid-late 90's. They then removed the C-Stage for the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/2-Stage" >}}">2-Stage</a> removed the 1988 Remodel decor and added new decor and SkyTubes. They would remain like this until the installation of the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/CEC 2005 Remodel Program" >}}">CEC 2005 Remodel</a> between 2008-2009 when they removed the Showroom Walls, Balcony Seating, and relocated the 2-Stage. In 2010, the 2-Stage was converted into a 1-Stage. In March 2024, Pico Rivera began their <a href="{{< ref "wiki/CEC 2018 20 Remodel Program" >}}">2.0 Remodel</a>, removing their 1-Stage not long after for a 2021 Model Dance Floor. The store would also receive the Trampoline Zone Package. As of April 2024, Pico Rivera still has the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Chuck E Live Stage (Dance Floor)" >}}">2021 Model Dance Floor</a> and <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Video Wall" >}}">Video Wall.</a></p>
