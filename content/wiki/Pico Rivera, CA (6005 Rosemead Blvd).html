<b><i>6005 Rosemead Blvd, Store #440</b></i> was a <i>Pizza Time Theatre</i> that opened sometime in 1982 (month and day unknown) with a Balcony Stage, which is still open as a <i>Chuck E. Cheese</i> with the [[CEC 2018 2.0 Remodel Program|2.0 Remodel]].
<h2>History</h2>
Pico Rivera opened sometime in 1982. Unfortunately, there is hardly any information about when it was a PTT, but they had a [[Cyberamics Balcony Stage|Balcony Stage]]. Pico Rivera had the stage and the store unchanged until the late 80s when they received the 1988 remodel. They removed the Balcony Stage for the [Chuck E.'s House Facade]({{< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House Facade.html" >}}) and added new decor. They would remain like this until their second remodel in the mid-late 90's. They then removed the C-Stage for the [2-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/2-Stage.html" >}}) removed the 1988 Remodel decor and added new decor and SkyTubes. They would remain like this until the installation of the [[CEC 2005 Remodel Program|CEC 2005 Remodel]] between 2008-2009 when they removed the Showroom Walls, Balcony Seating, and relocated the 2-Stage. In 2010, the 2-Stage was converted into a 1-Stage. In March 2024, Pico Rivera began their [[CEC 2018 2.0 Remodel Program|2.0 Remodel]], removing their 1-Stage not long after for a 2021 Model Dance Floor. The store would also receive the Trampoline Zone Package. As of April 2024, Pico Rivera still has the [[Chuck E. Live Stage (Dance Floor)|2021 Model Dance Floor]] and [[Video Wall|Video Wall.]]
