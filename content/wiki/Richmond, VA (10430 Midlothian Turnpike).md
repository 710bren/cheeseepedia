**10430 Midlothian Turnpike** was a Showbiz Pizza Place that opened on May 1, 1990 with a Rock-Afire Explosion, which is still open to this day

This location was the last Showbiz location opened with a Rock-Afire, as Concept Unification would be happening around this time, this location would very shortly after convert to a 3-Stage, which is still there.
