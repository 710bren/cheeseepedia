<h2> History </h2>
Fullerton opened in March 1980 (day unknown) with a Portrait Stage. Sadly, not much information is known about this location, other than a ceremony photo marking the grand opening. In 1981/1982, the exterior sign was possibly replaced. But in 1985 (month and day unknown), the location closed permanently, mainly because it wasn't performing well. As of today, the location is now home to BWON Shabu & BBQ.
