The **_General Cinema Corporation's Summer Movie Camp Commercial**_ is a lost Chuck E. Cheese's commercial advertising the 2001 Summer Movie Camp deal at select movie theatre locations.

It is theorized to advertise the free admission to a _General Cinema's_ Summer Movie Camp event with any purchase of a Super Server Meal at CEC, using a similar ad from 2001 in the [CEC Coca-Cola Triple Tabletop Ad Stand]({{< ref "wiki/CEC Coca-Cola Triple Tabletop Ad Stand.md" >}}).

A 35mm film for the commercial was placed on eBay on July 15, 2022. Its label reads:
 GCC's Summer Movie Camp
 'CHUCK-E-CHEESE'
