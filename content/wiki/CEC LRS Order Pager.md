The **_CEC LRS Order Pager**_ is a tabletop electronic pager that vibrates to alert customers that their order is ready to pick up. The pager began being used in stores in 2017.

The _Long Range Systems LLC Guest Connect Note_ is the pager used in the stores, being part of the _LRS Guest Connect Note Paging Kit_<ref>https://shop.lrsus.com/collections/guest-paging/products/lrs-guest-pager-note-kit?variant=53442164117</ref>_,_ a package including 15-60 notes (It is unclear currently which count of notes stores received), a transmitter, 2 power supplies, and a lid kit for custom inserts.

##  Design ## 
A custom sticker adorns the front of the pager, featuring a green background with a pizza in the middle. The top text states 'Quality takes Time. Your freshly-made pizza will be ready soon!'. Below the pizza is the Chuck E. Cheese's logo, along with a link to lrsus.com. Notably, even though the pagers were continued to be used past the brand change to just 'Chuck E. Cheese', none of the stickers were updated to accommodate the new logo.
