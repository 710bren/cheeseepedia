The articulated Chuck E. walkaround head was created in 1996 by former CEI employee, David “Billy Bob” Irving.

The head was used in one live show training tape that we know of, being the Get Ready training tape from 1997.<ref> https://youtu.be/_U_KTZy62ZI</ref> It has been assumed it was also in training tapes for other live shows such as Strike It Up. In addition, the head was used in the notorious CEC movie, _Chuck E. Cheese In The Galaxy 5000_.<ref> https://youtu.be/LvPDKzSaeyg</ref> During the movie, the head is seen with a custom outfit and later on into the film a Racer outfit.

## Appearance ##
The head itself is based off of the, at the time, newest variation of the in-store walkaround head from 1994. Just with some modifications. 

At first, the standard walkaround for the July 1996 show consisted of the Derby and Sports outfit with red shoes. This was until the 20th Anniversary show, when Chuck E. debuts with his Awesome Adventure Machine outfit. 

The shows also put variety into Chuck E's outfits for certain parts of a segment. For example, one segment he can have sunglasses and a Hawaiian shirt and the other he can have a Santa clause outfit.

For preparation of the Galaxy 5000 movie, the articulated head was updated by Billy Bob Irving to replace the original eyelashes and give him a red cap.
