<h2>History</h2>
This location opened on November 11, 2002, down the highway from the old Pizza Time Theatre which closed in 1984. The store would open with the 1993 Remodel. It would keep this remodel until April 2015 when they would receive the 2015 Remodel. They would remodel in January 2023 for the 2.0 Remodel.
<h2>Stages</h2>
This location opened with a Studio C 2000 32M, the newest stage shows for Chuck E. Cheeseâ€™s at that time, featuring the 32-movement Chuck E. Cheese animatronic created by Garner Holt Productions. Though this stage would only have one screen instead of all three. Sometime after receiving the 2015 Remodel, they would remove the TV frame and blue screen.
