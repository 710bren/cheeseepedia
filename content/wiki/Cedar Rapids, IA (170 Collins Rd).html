<p><h2>History</h2></p>
<p>Cedar Rapids opened on November 26th, 1981 as the 3rd ShowBiz Pizza store in Iowa with the Rock-afire Explosion show and was an expansion of the nearby Kmart which originally opened on November 19th, 1970. In 1988-1989, Cedar Rapids would receive a minor remodel removing the old Showbiz decor, adding some newer decor, and the Billy Bob stage layout being changed. Strangely, the exterior sign was not changed. In 1991, Cedar Rapids received Concept Unification and the 1988 Remodel removing older decor for newer decor, added Blue and White awnings, added checkers, and converted the Rock-afire Explosion band into the 3-Stage. The store remained as Showbiz even after Concept Unification, the sign was replaced sometime afterwards. Cedar Rapids underwent the another remodel in the late 90's which involved the removal of the Neon Signage, Blue and White Awnings, and all checkers around the store as well as adding SkyTubes and Toddler Zone. On November 18th, 2013, the location closed due to not being able to come to an agreement with the shopping center about lease. This store would remain abandoned for a few months until the entire shopping center was immediately redeveloped into a Hobby Lobby and a few businesses. Currently, as of May 2023, the Hobby lobby and the businesses are still here.</p>
