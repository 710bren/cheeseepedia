## History ##

### Pre CEC (1984 to 1989) ###
Springfield's Celebration Station opened sometime in 1984 but it was closed in 1989. The location would remain vacant for a while until the construction of CEC has began.

### CEC (1990-Present) ###
Sometime after the closure of Celebration Station, construction of the Springfield CEC has began. The store opened on December 4th, 1990 with a Road Stage Prototype (One of 4/5 Produced) and the 1988 Remodel. This was the only Road Stage installed in all of Pennsylvania. In around 1991/1992, the Road Stage Prototype was replaced with the finalized version, adding Wink above Mr. Munch. In around 1995/1996, the store would remodel to [Phase 1]({{< ref "wiki/Phase 1 (1994).md" >}}) of the 1994 SPT Repositioning / Remodel Program; with the removal of elements from the 1988 remodel such as the The Blue & White Awnings, checkers around the store, & neon lights; Also adding numerous pieces of 1990's decor & converting the Road Stage into a 2-Stage which had the Up and Down Curtains. In around the Early-Mid 2000's, Chuck's Tuxedo & Derby would be replaced with the Cool Chuck outfit. At some unknown periods of time, Jasper's PTT mask was repainted and the Up and Down Curtains were removed. By 2011, Chuck's Cool Chuck outfit was replaced with the Avenger outfit. The store closed for demolition for the current location on April 15th, 2012 due to the location being too expensive to remodel. The current location would open on November 14th, 2012 with a [Circles of Light]({{< ref "wiki/Circles of Light.md" >}}),Chuck E. Cheese 16m (Animatronic) (16m) and is still operational as of March 2023.
