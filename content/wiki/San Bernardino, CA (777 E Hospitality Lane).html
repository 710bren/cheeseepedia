<p><b><i>777 East Hospitality Lane, Store #375</b></i> is a <i>Chuck E. Cheese</i> that opened in June 27th, 2003 as a corporate store with a Studio C. Beta and still has the stage to this day.</p>
<p>It should not be confused with the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/San Bernardino, CA (955 South E St)" >}}">San Bernardino, CA (955 South E St)</a> location, which opened in December 1981 and closed on June 18, 2020.</p>
<p><h2>History</h2></p>
<p>San Bernardino opened its doors on June 27, 2003 with a Studio C. Beta show. Just like many other CEC stores that would open at the time, it would have a typical 2000s Chuck E. Cheese layout seen in other stores across the United States.</p>
<p>In 2014, the store would receive a remodel, upgrading the exterior to a Rockstar Chuck logo with the purple awning at the front, this would also come with the changes to the cosmetics of the Studio C. animatronic as it would be changed into a modern outfit, along with some new artwork replacing the old decor from the 2000s. In the Mid 2010s (Around 2015 or 2016), the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Skytubes" >}}">Skytubes</a> were removed, being replaced with the Giraffe Ride and other games. On November 2, 2019, a shooting occurred at this very store shortly after a brawl started in the parking lot. Luckily, no one was injured in the process, but the suspect fled the scene as soon as it happened.<sup>[1]</sup> San Bernardino would receive 2.0 in January 2024.</p>
<p><h2> Stages </h2></p>
<p>San Bernardino (Hospitality) opened with a Studio C Beta and has remained ever since its opening. The Studio C Beta likely had a Cool Chuck outfit on its opening, but unfortunately, no photos or videos exist of the figure in its outfit. The animatronic would receive a cosmetic upgrade, using the 2005 remodel outfit. Another cosmetic upgrade came in in 2014, phasing out the Avenger Chuck outfit with a new Rockstar Chuck outfit. The Studio C Beta was removed in January 2024 with the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Chuck E Live Stage (Dance Floor)" >}}">Chuck E. Live Stage</a>.</p>
