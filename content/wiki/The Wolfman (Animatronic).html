The Wolfman was created for the [Wolf Pack 5]({{< ref "wiki/Wolf Pack 5.md" >}}) show and debuted at the 1978 IAAPA. He is meant to be a parody of the radio DJ, Wolfman Jack. Wolfman's mask uses the same mold as [Buddy Crash]({{< ref "wiki/Buddy Crash (Animatronic).md" >}}) from the [Bear Country Jubilee]({{< ref "wiki/Bear Country Jubilee.md" >}}), with teeth and mustache glued on. His mech was later reused for Repete Thornsberry in the [Hard Luck Bears]({{< ref "wiki/Hard Luck Bears.md" >}}).
