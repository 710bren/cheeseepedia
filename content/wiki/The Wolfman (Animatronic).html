The Wolfman was created for the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Wolf Pack 5" >}}">Wolf Pack 5</a> show and debuted at the 1978 IAAPA. He is meant to be a parody of the radio DJ, Wolfman Jack. Wolfman's mask uses the same mold as <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Buddy Crash (Animatronic)" >}}">Buddy Crash</a> from the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Bear Country Jubilee" >}}">Bear Country Jubilee</a>, with teeth and mustache glued on. His mech was later reused for Repete Thornsberry in the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Hard Luck Bears" >}}">Hard Luck Bears</a>.
