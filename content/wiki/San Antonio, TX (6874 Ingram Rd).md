## History## 
San Antonio opened its doors in June 10th, 1981 with a Rock-afire Explosion show. It was originally and currently a corporate-owned store. It was also the first ever Showbiz Pizza in the state of Texas. It was the only Showbiz Pizza ever to open right next to a Denny's. Like many other ShowBiz locations, it had a typical SPP layout seen in many other stores across the United States and would eventually receive the 1988 remodel years after it would open. Although some little documentation exists back in the ShowBiz days, it can be determined that San Antonio was one of several locations to receive an Uncle Klunk show package (and a Santa Claus retrofit package as well) sometime after opening. Like many ShowBiz locations in the late 1980s, San Antonio received the Showbiz Pizza Campground upgrade.

In around 1991/1992, San Antonio received Concept Unification which converted the show to Munch's Make Believe Band. In around the Mid-Late 1900's, San Antonio received either [https://chuckepedia.com/wiki/Phase_1_(1994) Phase 1] or [https://chuckepedia.com/wiki/Phase_2_(1997) Phase 2] remodel which removed some early 90s decor and added new decor and SkyTubes. San Antonio remained this way until sometime in 2006-2007 when they received a major 2005 Remodel which involved removing the Showroom Walls, balcony Seating, and received a new exterior. They then received the Circles of Light stage in 2014 removing the 3-Stage bots and the stage was now behind it. They then received the 2.0 Remodel in 2017.
## Stages## 
San Antonio opened with the Rock afire Explosion in 1984. Unfortunately, there are hardly any photos or videos to exist of Fargo with the Rock afire, or as a ShowBiz in general. But, there is a photo of its original exterior.

In the 1990s, San Antonio received [https://chuckepedia.com/wiki/Concept_Unification Concept Unification], converting the Rock afire into Munchâ€™s Make Believe Band.

In 2017, San Antonio started the 2.0 Remodel, removing the Circles of Light and adding a Dance Floor + Video Wall.
