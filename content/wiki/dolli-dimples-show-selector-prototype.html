The <b><i>Dolli Dimples Show Selector</b></i> (no official name given) is a prototype selection unit for the {{- wiki-link "Kooser Dolli Dimples (Animatronic)" -}}.
<h2> History </h2>
Shortly after {{- wiki-link "Kooser Dolli Dimples (Animatronic)" -}} was installed at {{- wiki-link "San Jose, CA (1371 Kooser Rd)" -}}, Pizza Time Theatre prototyped for an alteration to Dolli's show playback to have a jukebox unit that could have coins inserted into it to play specific shows. The single prototype box would be moved throughout the early corporate offices before eventually being thrown in a scrap pile at the {{- wiki-link "Pizza Time Theatre Sunnyvale, CA Corporate Office" -}}. Dale Benjamin would recover the box and keep it with them till present day.<sup>(1)</sup>
