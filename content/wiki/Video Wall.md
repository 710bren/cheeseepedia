The **Video Wall** is an entertainment option found at Chuck E. Cheese restaurants, first being installed in March 2021 at the  location. 

The Video Walls are installed in present day 2.0 Remodels alongside the 2021 Model Dance Floor (some stores receive 2019 Dance Floors instead), with some stores (like , which did not open with one, as they were planning to open in 2020, before 2021 2.0's started being installed), later receiving one. 

The Video Walls bear a resemblance to the large TV screen featured on the [Circles of Light]({{< ref "wiki/Circles of Light.md" >}}) stage, and may or may not be the same model.

## History ##
When 2.0 Remodels started being installed, the only TV's in the store were the 6 small TV's mounted on the ceiling directly above the Dance Floor. This would change in 2021 when 2.0 Remodels were updated to include a large TV embedded into the wall where the character posters are.
