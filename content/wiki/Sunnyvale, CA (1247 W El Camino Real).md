Between its opening and 1981, it would receive the [Color Call-out Monitor System]({{< ref "wiki/Color Call-out Monitor System.md" >}}), being one of the few test locations.<ref name=':2'>https://ia800303.us.archive.org/21/items/paintingbynumbers/paintingbynumbersreel2.mp4</ref> An interview with Nolan Bushnell would be held at the location in 1981, later appearing in the documentary 'Painting By Numbers' by the BBC.<ref name=':2' /> In September of 1981, the store franchisers would win an award at the 1981 PTT Monterey Convention (Event) (1981 PTT Monterey Convention) for _Highest Average Sales_.<ref name=':1' />

In Winter of 1982, Joan Nelson, area representative for the then Marketing Sales Representative Program, had a near 50 person group scheduled to visit the store. Upon arriving, the store's power had cut out. Instead of turning the group away, Joan had the employees light up ash-trays and candles around the store. The group was served food and employees dressed up in multiple walkarounds singing Christmas carols to entertain the guests.<ref name=':3'>https://archive.org/details/the-pizza-times-newsletters/1983%20The%20Pizza%20Times%203-1/page/n3/mode/2up?q=sunnyvale</ref>

In early 1983, the store would be one of the only two locations to receive a [Chuck E. Cheese's Computer Learning Center]({{< ref "wiki/Chuck E Cheese's Computer Learning Center.md" >}}).<ref name=':3' />

The store would close in 1984.
