<b><i>1997 Aloma Ave</b></i> was a <i>Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre</i> that opened on January 26, 1981, and closed in February 1984 (day unknown) with a [[Cyberamics Balcony Stage|Balcony Stage]].

This was the first Chuck E. Cheese's to open in all of Florida, not counting Showbiz Pizzas.

<h2>Stage</h2>
Winter Park opened with a [[Cyberamics Balcony Stage|Balcony Stage]]. Their first Guest Star was Madame Oink, later Harmony Howlette later in 1981, Madame Oink in 1982, and Helen Henny in Summer 1983. The location closed in 1984, and the animatronics were auctioned.

<h2>History</h2>
Winter Park opened on January 26th, 1981, with a [[Cyberamics Balcony Stage|Balcony Stage]]. Barely any information is known about Winter Park, although there is one known picture from its opening. The exterior sign was likely replaced around 1982. The location would close in February 1984 (day unknown) due to underperformance and bankruptcy from the company. As of August 2023, the store is now part of a farmer's market.
