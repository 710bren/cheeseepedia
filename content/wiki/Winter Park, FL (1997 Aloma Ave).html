<h2>History</h2>
Winter Park opened on January 26th, 1981, with a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage" >}}">Balcony Stage</a>. Barely any information is known about Winter Park, although there is one known picture from its opening. The exterior sign was likely replaced around 1982. The location would close in February 1984 (day unknown) due to underperformance and bankruptcy from the company. As of August 2023, the store is now part of a farmer's market.
