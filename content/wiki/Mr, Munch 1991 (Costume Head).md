Mr. Munchâ€™s walkaround received new eyes in the style of the 1990 Chuck Walkaround. These eyes are made to look friendlier and more expressive with a large, round, white eye shine contrasting the black pupil. This is the only update made to the Mr. Munch Walkaround until the 1992 update adding hat attachments.
