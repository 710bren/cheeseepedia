<h2> Trivia </h2>

* Birmingham was the fifth ShowBiz Pizza Place in Alabama
*Huntsville was one of seven ShowBiz locations in Alabama to be converted into Chuck E. Cheese. The other six are [Mobile]({{< ref "wiki/Mobile, AL (710 Downtowner Loop).md" >}}), [Huntsville]({{< ref "wiki/Huntsville, AL (1220 Jordan Lane).md" >}}), [Montgomery]({{< ref "wiki/Montgomery, AL (2940 E South Blvd).md" >}}), [Birmingham (Roebuck)]({{< ref "wiki/Birmingham, AL (9325 Parkway East).md" >}}), [Dothan]({{< ref "wiki/Dothan, AL (3400 Ross Clark Circle).md" >}}), & [Sheffield]({{< ref "wiki/Sheffield, AL (4700 Hatch Blvd).md" >}}). The other three ShowBiz locations Tuscaloosa, AL (1335 McFarland Blvd) (Tuscaloosa), Cullman, AL (210 2nd Ave) (Cullman), & [Midfield]({{< ref "wiki/Midfield, AL (34 Phillips Dr).md" >}}) closed in December 1985 (Tuscaloosa), & April 1986 (Cullman & Midfield) respectively as they were the only three not to make it to Concept Unification. Midfield's show however ended up undergoing Concept Unification when it was installed at the [Tallahasssee]({{< ref "wiki/Tallahassee, FL (2810 Sharer Rd).md" >}}) location
* This location is probably best well known for spawning the infamous 'Abandoned Chuck E. Cheese animatronic' image, which went viral in early 2021.
