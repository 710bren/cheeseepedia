The **_15T Compressor System Video Tape**_ was a training tape released in 1992 detailing how to service the [3-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/3-Stage.md" >}}) _Ingersoll Rand_ compressor.

The only account of the tape's contents comes from a private owner, stating that the main portion of the video features a technician explaining how the compressor works, along with how to service it. A video from _Ingersoll Rand_ themselves is also features, going over similar issues and breakdowns of the compressor.<ref>https://www.instagram.com/p/CeR2CTnp5M36Rgnnrjn2mYNL80CaKGXCUaWYvY0/</ref> The claim also states another private owner having a  of the tape under the _Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza_ branding, presumably only on the tape's label.
