<b><i>Choo Choo</b></i> (Also Munch Jr.) was an animatronic prop figure featured on the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Rock-afire Explosion" >}}">Rock-afire Explosion</a>. It is a simple figure, as its only movement is raising up from his tree stump. On early versions of the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Concept Unification Stage" >}}">Concept Unification Stage</a>, he would also have a spotlight.
<h2> History </h2>
Choo Choo featured in Rock-afire Explosion shows first debuting in 1980 at the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Jacksonville, FL (9820 Atlantic Blvd)" >}}">Jacksonville, FL (9820 Atlantic Blvd)</a> on August 14th of that year.
Choo Choo would later be converted to Munch Jr. during <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Concept Unification" >}}">Concept Unification</a>, now resembling a smaller Mr. Munch with a propeller cap. Munch Jr. would additionally gain a spotlight used from the original <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Antioch (Animatronic)" >}}">Antioch</a> spotlight. He would later lose his spotlight with the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/September '94" >}}">September '94</a> showtape, as stores were instructed to switch the spotlight out with a gobo light that faced the center stage curtains.
The last official Munch Jr. in a store was at the Wilmington, North Carolina location, which would close in October of 2020.
