<b><i>Choo Choo</b></i> (Also Munch Jr.) was an animatronic prop figure featured on the [Rock-afire Explosion]({{< ref "wiki/Rock-afire Explosion.html" >}}). It is a simple figure, as its only movement is raising up from his tree stump. On early versions of the [Concept Unification Stage]({{< ref "wiki/Concept Unification Stage.html" >}}), he would also have a spotlight.

<h2> History </h2>
Choo Choo featured in Rock-afire Explosion shows first debuting in 1980 at the [Jacksonville, FL (9820 Atlantic Blvd)]({{< ref "wiki/Jacksonville, FL (9820 Atlantic Blvd).html" >}}) on August 14th of that year.

Choo Choo would later be converted to Munch Jr. during [Concept Unification]({{< ref "wiki/Concept Unification.html" >}}), now resembling a smaller Mr. Munch with a propeller cap. Munch Jr. would additionally gain a spotlight used from the original [[Antioch (Animatronic)|Antioch]] spotlight. He would later lose his spotlight with the [September '94]({{< ref "wiki/September '94.html" >}}) showtape, as stores were instructed to switch the spotlight out with a gobo light that faced the center stage curtains.

The last official Munch Jr. in a store was at the Wilmington, North Carolina location, which would close in October of 2020.
