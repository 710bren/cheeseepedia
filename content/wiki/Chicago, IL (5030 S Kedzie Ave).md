**5030 S Kedzie Ave** was a Showbiz Pizza Place that opened on November 1, 1984 with a Rock-Afire Explosion, which is still open to this day.

This location received Concept Unification in 1991 or 1992, and received a [CU Beta 16M]({{< ref "wiki/CU Beta 16M.md" >}}) in 2020.

## Stages ##
Originally when they store opened, they had a Rock-Afire Explosion, as all other Showbiz Pizza Place's did, they would have it for a short time, until 1991 or 1992, when they would undergo the process known as Concept Unification, this was the process used to turn the RAE into the Chuck E. Cheese characters. They would have the 3-Stage for many years, until October-November 2020, when they would receive the 16M Studio C Chuck E. Bot, and Studio C Beta swirl backdrop and light up mirrors from the Lafayette, Indiana, which had closed at the time. The reason for the replacement was because the 3-Stage is very hard to maintain, and with parts being hard to find not helping, they replaced the stage. As of October 2022, they still have the CU Beta 16M, along with Darien, Illinois, which also has the same stage, although theirs is slightly different than Kedzie's.
