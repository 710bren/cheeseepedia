**_Billy Bob's Wonderland**_ is a FEC located in Barboursville, West Virginia. They are well-known for being one of the last public places in the US and the world to view . 

## History ##

Billy Bob's Wonderland originally opened in 1989, with the first location being in East Barboursville, which was a fomer Showbiz Pizza Place that rebranded the exterior and interior to avoid [Concept Unification]({{< ref "wiki/Concept Unification.md" >}}). They later opened a second location in Ashland, KY, and both locations combined in 2003 to become the larger location they still reside in today at 5 Cracker Barrel Dr, Barboursville, WV 25504.

## Relationship with Creative Engineering ##
In 2013, Aaron Fechter of Creative Engineering came to try and fix the show, but left shortly thereafter after supposedly offensive comments that the owner had said about him.

## Animatronics ##
In addition to the show on the stage in the current location, they have spare shows in crates.
