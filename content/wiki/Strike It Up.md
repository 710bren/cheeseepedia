<h2>Trivia</h2>
*The song's audio has been found, but is missing the initial announcer voice and countdown. Only a single second of the tape video has been found, as it was used in the [May 1998 Show]({{< ref "wiki/May 1998 Show.md" >}}) during Segment 2. It is believed that parts from the August 1996 show used bluescreen footage from Strike It Up. Signals are also missing for this show.
