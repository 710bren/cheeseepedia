<b><i>Diamond Bar, CA (1900 S Brea Canyon Rd), Store #409</b></i> was a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Pizza Time Theatre" >}}">Pizza Time Theatre</a> in Diamond Bar, California that opened in 1983 and closed in April 2020.
<h2> History </h2>
Diamond Bar opened sometime in 1983 with a Balcony Stage<sup><a href="1">1</a></sup>. Diamond Bar would have the Balcony Stage for a few years until 1989-1990 when they converted the show into Chuck E.'s House Facade. They would get the CEC 1988 Remodel|1988 Remodel around this timeframe. They would then have Chuck E.'s House Facade for a few more years until they got the 1-Stage sometime in the mid-1990s. The Showroom (Which was located on the right side of the entrance.) was moved to where the Cheese Crawl and Skee-Ball area. The former showroom was replaced with windows. This also changed Chuck's outfit to the Tuxedo & Derby outfit. In the Mid 2000's Chuck's Tuxedo & Derby was replaced with the Cool Chuck outfit. The 2000-2010's saw many changes to Diamond Bar including the removal of Dim lighting, Showroom Walls, adding purple walls, & numerous other changes throughout the store. In around Early Mid 2018, The CRTs were replaced with Flatscreen TVs. Chuck's Cool Chuck was replaced with the Rockstar outfit not long after that. Diamond Bar from there would remain mostly unchanged until the store's closure in April 2020 as one of the first three stores to close permanently during the COVID-19 Pandemic. The building would remain vacant until May 2022, when the facility would begin demolition. As of 2023, the location has been rebuilt as a possible dentist office.
