<h2> History </h2>
Fontana opened in November 1983 with a [Balcony Stage]({{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage.md" >}}), which was to the right of the entrance. In 1988/89, they got the [SPT 1988 Remodel Program]({{< ref "wiki/SPT 1988 Remodel Program.md" >}}), retrofitting the Balcony Stage to [Chuck E.'s House Facade]({{< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House Facade.md" >}}). Later in 1994/95, they received the SPT 1992/1993 Remodel Program, and got a [2-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/2-Stage.md" >}}). Then in late 2006, they received the [CEC 2005 Remodel Program]({{< ref "wiki/CEC 2005 Remodel Program.md" >}}), relocated the showroom, and got a [Studio C Beta]({{< ref "wiki/Studio C Beta.md" >}}). In April 2023, they received the [CEC 2018 2.0 Remodel Program]({{< ref "wiki/CEC 2018 20 Remodel Program.md" >}}) removing the Studio C for a Chuck E. Live Stage (Dance Floor) (Dance Floor) + [Video Wall]({{< ref "wiki/Video Wall.md" >}}). As of October 2023, Fontana remains like this.
