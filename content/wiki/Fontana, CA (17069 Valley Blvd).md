Fontana California opened 1983 with a balcony stage and is still open to this day with the 2018 CEC remodel program.




History:

Chuck e cheese's in fontana California opened November 1983 with a balcony stage which was to the right of the entrance. Somewhere in the late 80's, (estimate Is 1988/89) they got the showbiz 1988 remodel. There is footage of the king animatronic and the gamefloor. Later, they got the cool chuck sign and also got a two stage. I forgot to mention they had a c stage after 1988 remodel. And then in late 2006, they relocated the showroom and got studio c. And finally, in April 2023, they got remodeled for the dance floor. They are still open to this day with the dance floor.
