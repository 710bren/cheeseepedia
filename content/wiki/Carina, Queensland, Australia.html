<b><i>1151 Creek Rd</b></i> was a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Charlie Cheese's Pizza Playhouse" >}}"><i>Charlie Cheese's Pizza Playhouse</i></a> that opened in 1982 with a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage" >}}">Balcony Stage</a> and closed between 1984 and 1986.
This store was a relocation of the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Surfer's Paradise, Queensland, Australia" >}}">Surfer's Paradise</a> location and would be the last location to open in Australia.
<h2> Stage </h2>
Charlie Cheese's would have a standard <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage" >}}">Balcony Stage</a> and would have Cyberamic characters likely to have came from the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Surfer's Paradise, Queensland, Australia" >}}">previous location</a>. Because of this it is well to say that this location kept the Madam Oink character until they received the Bandstand Show in-around 1984.
It is also unknown if they've also relocated the Dolli Dimples Cyberamic to this new location.
<h2> History </h2>
Little is known about this store as opposed to it's <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Surfer's Paradise, Queensland, Australia" >}}">original location in Surfers Paradise</a> other than the location closing due to Pizza Time Theatre's bankruptcy.
