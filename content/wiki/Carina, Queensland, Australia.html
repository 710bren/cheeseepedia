<p><b><i>1151 Creek Rd</b></i> was a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Charlie Cheese's Pizza Playhouse" >}}"><i>Charlie Cheese's Pizza Playhouse</i></a> that opened in 1982 with a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage" >}}">Balcony Stage</a> and closed between 1984 and 1986.</p>
<p>This store was a relocation of the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Surfer's Paradise, Queensland, Australia" >}}">Surfer's Paradise</a> location and would be the last location to open in Australia.</p>
<p><h2> Stage </h2></p>
<p>Charlie Cheese's would have a standard <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage" >}}">Balcony Stage</a> and would have Cyberamic characters likely to have came from the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Surfer's Paradise, Queensland, Australia" >}}">previous location</a>. Because of this it is well to say that this location kept the Madam Oink character until they received the Bandstand Show in-around 1984.</p>
<p>It is also unknown if they've also relocated the Dolli Dimples Cyberamic to this new location.</p>
<p><h2> History </h2></p>
<p>Little is known about this store as opposed to it's <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Surfer's Paradise, Queensland, Australia" >}}">original location in Surfers Paradise</a> other than the location closing due to Pizza Time Theatre's bankruptcy.</p>
