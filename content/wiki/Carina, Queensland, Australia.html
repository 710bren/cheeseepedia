This store was a relocation of the [[Surfer's Paradise, Queensland, Australia|Surfer's Paradise]] location and would be the last location to open in Australia.

<h2> Stage </h2>
Charlie Cheese's would have a standard [[Cyberamics Balcony Stage|Balcony Stage]] and would have Cyberamic characters likely to have came from the [[Surfer's Paradise, Queensland, Australia|previous location]]. Because of this it is well to say that this location kept the Madam Oink character until they received the Bandstand Show in-around 1984.

It is also unknown if they've also relocated the Dolli Dimples Cyberamic to this new location.

<h2> History </h2>
Little is known about this store as opposed to it's [[Surfer's Paradise, Queensland, Australia|original location in Surfers Paradise]] other than the location closing due to Pizza Time Theatre's bankruptcy.
