The Winchester Boulevard Portrait Show was the first instance of a portrait/shelf show at Chuck E Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre, and the first animatronic show overall at the restaurants. The show opened at the first Pizza Time Theatre, in Winchester Blvd., San Jose, CA in 1977, and only appeared at that location.
