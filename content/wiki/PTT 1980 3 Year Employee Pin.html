<h2>Acquirement</h2>
Employees could only receive this pin after being an employee at Pizza Time Theatre for 3 consecutive years. This pin specifically was given out to employees at the original <i>San Jose, CA (370 S Winchester Blvd) [Pizza Time Theatre]({{< ref "wiki/Pizza Time Theatre.html" >}})</i> location who began work at the store's opening or throughout 1977.
