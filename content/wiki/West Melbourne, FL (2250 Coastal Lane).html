<b><i>2250 Coastal Lane, Store #699</b></i> is a [Chuck E. Cheese's]({{< ref "wiki/Chuck E Cheese's.md" >}}) that opened on April 26, 2011 with the [Galaxy Stage]({{< ref "wiki/Galaxy Stage.md" >}}), which is still open to this day.

The Galaxy Stage is a test stage that was only installed in this location, and was the predecessor to the [Circles of Light]({{< ref "wiki/Circles of Light.md" >}}) stage.

<h2>History</h2>
West Melbourne opened on April 26th, 2011 as the location with the 2010 Update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative & tested the Galaxy Stage Prototype. When the store opened, the store had a unique mural on the windows in the Toddler Zone area. In the Showroom next to the stage, they also had Green Walls. In 2020, the Toddler Zone was removed, alongside the mural on the windows and Skytubes. In April 2023, West Melbourne would start their 2.0 Remodel which involved the removal of the Galaxy Stage Prototype, Green Walls that were on the sides of the stage, & Star Stage character posters on the side walls of the Showroom. 

<h2>Stages</h2>
This location opened with the [Galaxy Stage]({{< ref "wiki/Galaxy Stage.md" >}}), which was a test stage only installed in this location. On April 10, 2023, West Melbourne removed the one and only Galaxy Stage for a 2021 Model Dance Floor & Video Wall during their 2.0 Remodel, marking it's extinction.
