Around 1995/1996, the location received <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Phase 1 (1994)" >}}">Phase 1</a>, removing all 1988 remodel elements, and changed the exterior. They later received <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Phase 2 (1997)" >}}">Phase 2</a> and <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Phase 3 (2000)" >}}">Phase 3</a> in their respective years.

In around the late 2010s, the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Skytubes" >}}">Skytubes</a> were removed. In October 2023 Springfield, MO would begin its 2.0 refresh. As of July 2024, Springfield remains like this with the 2.0 remodel and the Dance Floor with the Video Wall.</p>
