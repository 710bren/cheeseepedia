##History##

##Stages##
Originally when the store opened, they had a Rock-Afire Explosion, as all other Showbiz locations did. They would have it for a few years, until around 1991-1992, when they would undergo Concept Unification, this was the process used to turn the RAE into the CEC characters. In the Mid 1990's Chuck's mask was replaced with a newer one.
