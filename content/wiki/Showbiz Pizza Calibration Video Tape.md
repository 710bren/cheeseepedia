The <b><i>ShowBiz Pizza Calibration Video Tape</b></i> was a diagnostic Rock-afire Explosion showtape released in ShowBiz Pizza Place locations in 1983.

The show was formatted on [CEI Betamax]({{< ref "wiki/CEI Betamax.md" >}}), allowing employees to place a TV in front of the stage to compare the movements of their stage to the diagnostics.
