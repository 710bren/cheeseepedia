## Trivia: ##
* This was the first Studio C show to feature the puppets as the on screen counter part for Helen, Munch, Jasper and Pasqually. Prior to this show the walkaround costumes were used.
* The background for the Studio C puppets is random paints thrown at a wall. 
* The changes between Studio C and Existing shows is some intermissions being moved around and Chuck singing 'Cheese Pizza is Pure Delight' instead of Jasper.
* Duncan Brannan's voice for Chuck E. has gotten much lower and evolved into his 'Avenger Chuck' tone, and his New Jersey accent is now minimal-sounding.
* This was the last original showtape before the release of the _Galaxy 5000_ movie.
* Chuck E. sings 'Cheese Pizza is Pure Delight' in the Studio C version while Jasper sings it in the Existing Stages version.
