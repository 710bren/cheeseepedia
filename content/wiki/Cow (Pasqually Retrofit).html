<b><i>Cow</b></i> (also known as <b><i>The Cow</b></i>) was a retrofit of <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Pasqually (Cyberamic)" >}}">Pasqually (Cyberamic)</a> used at the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Fun Zone & Pizza" >}}">Fun Zone & Pizza</a> on <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Chico, CA (966 East Ave)" >}}">Chico, CA (966 East Ave)</a>. The bot was retrofitted after the location lost its license to the CEC IP.
<h2> History </h2>
<h3> As Pasqually </h3>
The bot was originally produced somewhere from 1981 to 1982 & was placed at the Pizza Time Theatre on <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Chico, CA (966 East Ave)" >}}">Chico, CA (966 East Ave)</a> in July 1982. The bot had standard PTT attire. In 1993, The bot would gain new CEC styled cosmetics when Chico got their <a href="{{< ref "wiki/2-Stage" >}}">2-Stage</a>. The bot also replaced its former arm mechanics for new arm mechanics
<h3> As The Cow </h3>
In January 2011, The Chuck E. Cheese's in <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Chico, CA (966 East Ave)" >}}">Chico, CA</a> lost its license to run as a CEC, forcing them to change their branding to Fun Zone & Pizza. They converted their Munch's Make Believe Band characters into generic animals, The Cow uses a generic mascot costume instead of the Pasqually Cyberamic ones, though they still had the originally Drum from their <a href="{{< ref "wiki/2-Stage" >}}">2-Stage</a> that had the Spiral Star design. The bot's head had a tin can either over it or replacing its former one.
When Fun Zone & Pizza closed in September 2011, the characters were stripped from their cosmetics and removed and sold in a group for $100. It is unknown if anybody purchased them or where they are today.
