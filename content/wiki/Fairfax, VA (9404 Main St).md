<h2>History </h2>
Fairfax originally opened on December 22nd, 1983, as the 4th Showbiz Pizza Store in Virginia as part of the expansion of the center it was in. Fairfax originally featured the Rock-Afire Explosion, as were all the other Showbiz locations. Fairfax would have it for a few years, but before Concept Unification, their exterior was unique as it had no Showbiz Pizza logo, but it did have the stripes near the entrance. until around 1991 or 1992, when they would receive the 1988 remodel, receiving Concept Unification, where the Rock-Afire Explosion characters were changed to the Chuck E. Cheese characters, and removing all SPP decor for newer decor. In the Late 1990's, the store would receive the Phase 2 Remodel, removing older decor for newer decor, an exterior logo was added, and SkyTubes. In 2000, the 3-Stage was removed for the Studio C Alpha. Around the 2006/2007, Fairfax remodeled to the 2005 Update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative which involved the Showroom walls being torn down, the relocation of the Salad Bar, the removal of old decor for newer decor, logo exterior change, and road sign change. Fairfax remained like this until in October 2018 when they started their 2017 2.0 Remodel Program (2.0 Remodel) which involved the removal of the Alpha for a 2017 Model Dance Floor + Video Wall. As of August 2023, Fairfax still has the 2.0 Remodel and 2017 Model Dance Floor + Video Wall.
<h2>Stages</h2>
