## Trivia: ##
*There are 3 floppy disc versions for this show. Version B adds an EDIT.COM file not in the original floppy. It is currently unknown what it does. It is also unknown if the Final Version has any major changes.
* The intros to the Ken Chuck E. Derby intermissions reused from [Holiday Special 1992]({{< ref "wiki/Holiday Special 1992.md" >}}) were rerecorded at the last minute due to issues with the original Don Pardo recordings. As this was done at the last minute, they were unable to be added to the Studio C version and were exclusive to Existing Stages. The original 1993 versions of these intermissions are hidden on the Studio C DVDs with updated music.
*The countdowns and some songs reuse footage from [Holiday Special 1992]({{< ref "wiki/Holiday Special 1992.md" >}}), [The Chuck E. Cheese Christmas Special]({{< ref "wiki/The Chuck E Cheese Christmas Special.md" >}}) and Chuck E.'s Holiday Party 1999. 'Jingle Bells' also reuses footage from the 'Snowdaze' intermission in [Let The Good Times Roll]({{< ref "wiki/Let The Good Times Roll.md" >}}).
*The Larry The Technician intermission in this show was the final new piece of Larry animation. The rest of his animated appearances would use reused footage. This show also features Larry celebrating Christmas, despite the fact that he is said to celebrate Hanukkah in Holiday Party.
*This is one of the most reused shows, as segments from this show would continue to be reused until the [December 2012 show]({{< ref "wiki/December 2012 Show.md" >}}).
