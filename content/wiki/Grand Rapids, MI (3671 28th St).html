<p><h2> History </h2></p>
<p>Grand Rapids opened on June 6th, 1983 in the Eastbrook Mall (now called the Shops at CenterPoint) as possibly the 12th and last Showbiz Pizza Place in Michigan (12th after <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Southgate, MI (15300 Toledo Rd)" >}}">Southgate</a>, <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Saginaw, MI (5105 Bay Rd)" >}}">Saginaw</a>, Walker, MI (3175 Alpine Ave)|Walker, <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Pontiac, MI (965 S Opdyke Rd)" >}}">Pontiac</a>, <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Benton Harbor, MI (1956 Pipestone Rd)" >}}">Benton Harbor</a>, Jackson, MI (1050 W Argyle St)|Jackson, <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Flint, MI (3489 Miller Rd)" >}}">Flint</a>, <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Dearborn, MI (24399 Michigan Ave)" >}}">Dearborn</a>, Portage, MI (6700 S Westnedge Ave)|Portage, Muskegon, MI (3524 Green St)|Muskegon, & Farmington Hills, MI (29955 Orchard Lake Rd)|Farmington Hills) as a corporate-owned store. Grand Rapids originally featured the Rock-afire Explosion, as all other Showbiz locations did. Grand Rapids would have it for a few years, until around 1991, when they would receive the 1988 remodel, receiving Concept Unification, where the Rock-Afire Explosion characters were changed to the Chuck E. Cheese characters, adding Blue and White awnings above the salad bar, added checkers around inside and outside the store, and removing all SPP decor for CEC decor.</p>
<p>In around 1999/2000, Grand Rapids would receive the another remodel which removed all older 90's decor, added newer decor, removed all checkers inside and outside of the store, removed the 3-Stage for the Studio C Alpha, and added SkyTubes and Toddler Zone. In 2006-2007, Grand Rapids received the 2005 Update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative removing older decor, removing the Showroom Walls, Balcony Seating, and painting the walls purple, and adding bright florescent lighting. As of October 2023, Grand Rapids has reopened with their 2.0 remodel.</p>
<p><h2> Stages </h2></p>
<p>Originally, Grand Rapids featured a Rock-Afire Explosion, as all other Showbiz locations did. In 1991, they would undergo Concept Unification, turning the Rock-Afire Explosion into the 3-Stage.</p>
<p>Grand Rapids would have the 3-Stage until sometime in 1999/2000 when the 3-Stage was replaced with a Studio C Alpha. In around the Mid 2000's, Chuck 's Late Night Tuxedo would be replaced with the Cool Chuck outfit. By 2012, that was replaced with the Avenger outfit. Chuck's cap would be removed in September 2013. In July 2023, Grand Rapids would remove their Studio C Alpha as they received the 2.0 remodel.</p>
