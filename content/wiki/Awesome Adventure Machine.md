**General Information  **

The Awesome Adventure Machine was a test stage that was held at the original Montfort Drive, Dallas Texas location. This was a one of a kind stage that only had one major character animatronic for the show. A first in Chuck E Cheese history at that time. To make up for absents of the other characters the company came up with an easy solution, and that is to have video screens that features the other cast in walkaround form with articulated heads that interreact with the segment of the show. The general concept of the Awesome Adventure Machine was to take guests on many adventures around the world or through time. With Chuck E Cheese as the pilot for the machine with his many of robotic sidekicks as part of the show.
