|nrae=y}}**_Toy Show Tape 1**_ was the showtape used for Billy Bob's Toyland Adventure Show, which featured at the _IAAPA_ in November of 1995.

The showtape was presumably sent alongside the show to the Family Entertainment Center that purchased it from South America.

## IAAPA Debut ##
The showtape would debut at the IAAPA 1995 convention along with the Toyland stage itself. To the left of the stage was the New RAE Lite-CS with Karaoke and NRAE Mini Stage. Each show would play a single segment before passing it onto the next stage. The only [https://youtu.be/I-uKRa6aa5M?t=465 footage of this showtape] during the convention comes from _Brian Hagan_, who uploaded it onto YouTube on December 18, 2021, featuring _Segment 13: Hot Fun in the Summertime._
