Grand Junction, CO (US-6 81505,) is a Chuck E. Cheese's that opened on August 27th, 2003 and closed on June 19th, 2020 with a Studio C Cappa Prototype.

History:

Grand Junction opened outside of the Mesa Mall, It had a Studio C Cappa Prototype with a 16m Chuck E. Cheese Animatronic with the Phase 3 Remodel.

It also had a Cool Chuck sign near the mall's enterance.

The bot had the Cool Chuck outfit before switching to the Avenger outfit in the 2010's, and getting the Rockstar shirt, but keeping the Avenger shorts until closure.

The store had kept the Phase 3 exterior, but got the 2005 Update in 2016, but kept some Phase 3 stuff after remodeling.

Grand Junction remained like this until it's closure in 2020 due to the COVID-19 and the bankruptcy.


Closure: Grand Junction closed and left the awning and letter signs intact until being removed in 2021.

An employee said Grand Junction used to be haunted and reported ghost sightings after hours.


Post-CEC: After closure as a Chuck E. Cheese: the location remained vacant until an arcade moved into the former CEC until closing in 2022.

And now, as of September 2023, the building is vacant again.
