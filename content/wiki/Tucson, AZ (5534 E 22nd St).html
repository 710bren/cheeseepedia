<p><b><i>Tucson, AZ (5534 E 22nd St)</b></i> was a <i>Pizza Time Theatre</i> in Tucson, Arizona that opened in July 15, 1980 with a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Portrait  Shelf Stage" >}}">Portrait Stage</a>.</p>
<p>This is not to be confused with the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Tucson, AZ (8616 E Broadway Blvd)" >}}">Tucson, AZ (8616 E Broadway Blvd)</a> Pizza Time Theatre that opened on May 4th, 1981 and closed in 1983 with a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage" >}}">Balcony Stage</a>.

<p><h2>History</h2></p>
<p>The store would open on July 15th, 1980 in the <i>County Fair Shopping Center</i> with a Portrait Stage.</p>
<p>This was also the first Chuck E. Cheese of any kind to open in the state of Arizona.</p>
<p>Not much is known about the location other than the one photo of the store's exterior and a photo of the Portrait Stage taken from a memorial website.</p>
<p>The store was then closed in 1987 for unknown reasons (though it may have been underperforming, a reason for many store closures around the same time) after operating for around 7 years. The show's fate is unknown.</p>
<p>The store would become a few businesses or two until the shopping center was redeveloped in 2007. The original Pizza Time Theatre was expanded and redeveloped and is currently part of a Walmart Neighborhood Market.</p>
