<b><i>Tucson, AZ (5534 E 22nd St)</b></i> was a <i>Pizza Time Theatre</i> in Tucson, Arizona that opened in July 15, 1980 with a Cyberamics Portrait / Shelf Stage (Portrait Stage).  

This is not to be confused with the [Tucson, AZ (8616 E Broadway Blvd)]({{< ref "wiki/Tucson, AZ (8616 E Broadway Blvd).md" >}}) Pizza Time Theatre that opened on May 4th, 1981 and closed in 1983 with a [Balcony Stage]({{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage.md" >}}). This is also not to be confused with the [Tucson, AZ (6130 E Speedway Blvd)]({{< ref "wiki/Tucson, AZ (6130 E Speedway Blvd).md" >}}) location which opened in April 1995 with a [1-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/1-Stage.md" >}}) and was relocated to [Tucson, AZ (6125 E Speedway Blvd)]({{< ref "wiki/Tucson, AZ (6125 E Speedway Blvd).md" >}}) in October 2014 with a [Circles of Light, 16m]({{< ref "wiki/Circles of Light.md" >}}) and still operates to this day.

<h2>History</h2>
The store would open on July 15th, 1980 in the <i>County Fair Shopping Center</i> with a Portrait Stage.

This was also the first Chuck E. Cheese of any kind to open in the state of Arizona.

Not much is known about the location other than the one photo of the store's exterior and a photo of the Portrait Stage taken from a memorial website.

The store was then closed in 1987 for unknown reasons (though it may have been underperforming, a reason for many store closures around the same time) after operating for around 7 years. The show's fate is unknown.

The store would become a few businesses or two until the shopping center was redeveloped in 2007. The original Pizza Time Theatre was expanded and redeveloped and is currently part of a Walmart Neighborhood Market.
