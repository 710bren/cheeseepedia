<h2> Stage </h2>
Bellevue opened with a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/1-Stage" >}}">1-Stage</a>, which they still have to this day.

They at first had the tuxedo outfit, later the Cool Chuck outfit. The curtains were disabled sometime in the 2005 time period, and later completely removed all together.

<h2> History </h2>
Bellevue opened sometime in or around February 1996 (day unknown). with a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/1-Stage" >}}">1-Stage</a> and the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Phase 1 (1994)" >}}">Phase I</a> remodel. Unfortunately, there isn't much info on Bellevue from around this time. In 2008/2009, Bellevue received the 2005 update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative, which involved the removal of 90s decor, showroom walls, balcony seating, and the addition of purple walls and an exterior change. As of March 2024, Bellevue remains like this.
