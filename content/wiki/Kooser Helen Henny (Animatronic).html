<b><i>Kooser Helen Henny</b></i> was a Guest Star animatronic featured at the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/San Jose, CA (1371 Kooser Rd)" >}}">San Jose, CA (1371 Kooser Rd)</a> Pizza Time Theatre. She was alternated with other guest stars until 1980, when Kooser would upgrade to the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage" >}}">Balcony Show</a>
<h2> History </h2>
After Kooser upgraded to the Balcony show, Helen's whereabouts were unknown. It's assumed she was moved to <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Pizza Time Theatre Sunnyvale, CA Corporate Office" >}}">Sunnyvale</a>, but unlike <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Kooser Chuck E Cheese (Animatronic)" >}}">Chuck E</a>, there are no pictures of her at Sunnyvale. She is currently presumed to have been destroyed when Sunnyvale relocated to <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Showbiz Pizza Time Corporate Office" >}}">Texas</a> after PTT's bankruptcy.
<h2> Design </h2>
Kooser Helen is an upgraded version of <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Winchester Helen Henny (Animatronic)" >}}">Winchester Helen Henny</a>.
