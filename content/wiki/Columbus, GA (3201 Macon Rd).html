<h2>History</h2>
Columbus opened its doors on February 17th, 1982 as the third Showbiz Pizza Place in Georgia with a Rock-afire Explosion show. It was originally and currently a corporate-owned store. Like many other ShowBiz Pizza locations, it had a typical SPP layout seen in many other stores across the United States and would eventually receive the 1988 remodel years after it would open. Although very little documentation exists back in the ShowBiz days, it can be determined that Columbus was one of several locations to receive an Uncle Klunk show package (and a Santa Claus retrofit package as well) sometime after opening. Like many ShowBiz locations in the late 1980s, Columbus received the Showbiz Pizza Campground upgrade.
In around 1991/1992, Columbus received Concept Unification which converted the show to Munch's Make Believe Band. In around the Mid-Late 1990's, Columbus received either <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Phase 1 (1994)" >}}">Phase 1</a> or <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Phase 2 (1997)" >}}">Phase 2</a> remodel which removed some early 90's decor and added new decor and SkyTubes. Columbus remained this way until sometime in 2006-2007 when they received the 2005 Remodel which involved removing the Showroom Walls, Balcony Seating, received a new exterior, and also removing some older 90's decor. In 2011, Columbus removed the 3-Stage for the installation for the CU 1-Stage. <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Whitehall, PA (1000 Lehigh Valley Mall)" >}}">Whitehall, PA (1000 Lehigh Valley Mall)</a> and <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Springfield, IL (2369 McArthur Ave)" >}}">Springfield, IL (2369 McArthur Ave)</a> also received this special stage. That would involve moving the stage from the left side wall to the back wall, converting the space where the 3-Stage used to be into space for more games.
On April 24th, 2023, Columbus removed their CU 1-Stage for their 2.0 Remodel, being replaced with a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Chuck E Live Stage (Dance Floor)" >}}">Dance Floor</a> and <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Video Wall" >}}">Video Wall</a>. They were the first CU 1-Stage to be removed and the second last set of CEI bots in the state of Georgia. The last set, <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Augusta, GA (3435 Wrightsboro Rd)" >}}">Augusta</a> (A <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Concept Unification Stage" >}}">3-Stage</a>), removed theirs the next day as a part of their 2.0 Remodel. The store's Grand Reopening occurred on May 18th, 2023 with Chuck E. and Pasqually making an appearance at the store<sup><a href="1">1</a></sup><sup><a href="2">2</a></sup>.
