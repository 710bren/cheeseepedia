## Gameplay## 
Upon putting credits to the game, the gameplay of this arcade machine would start off with an announcer telling the player to 'Check the score first!' while giving the player twenty seconds to hit the red button with the targeted amount of force, and flashing the indicated number next to the 'TARGET SCORE' for four seconds. Afterwards, the player would be prepared to try to hit the button at the middle of the machine with the targeted amount of force with the machine announcing 'Ready? Get set.. HIT IT!'. Once the red button is hit, the ball that is inside the arcade machine would spin around clockwise based on how much force the player gave, scoring a point for each time the ball spins over the top of the spinner and getting slower based on the amount of force the player gave to the button until it stops spinning. If the player's score is closer to the targeted score, the machine would count down beginning three numbers before from the targeted score is reached, and if the player's score reaches the targeted score, the machine would reward the player with a jackpot amount of tickets. If the player's score isn't at the targeted score, the machine would compliment the player for trying their best while awarding an amount of tickets based on how far away they were from the target score.<ref>https://youtu.be/dKvvS8ygheU</ref>
