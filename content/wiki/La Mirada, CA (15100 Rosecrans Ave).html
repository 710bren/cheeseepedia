<b><i>La Mirada, CA (15100 Rosecrans Ave)</b></i> is a <i>Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza</i> that opened on February 25, 1992 with a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Road Stage" >}}">Road Stage</a>, and is still open with the 2.0 remodel.
<h2> Stages </h2>
La Mirada opened with a Road Stage with Chuck's tuxedo. There isn't much documentation on their stage, but Chuck's tuxedo was replaced in the 2000s with the Cool Chuck and Avenger outfits. By the end of 2013, Chuck's cap was removed. The stage remained like this until November 2022, when the stage was removed and destroyed for a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Chuck E Live Stage (Dance Floor)" >}}">Dance Floor</a> and <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Video Wall" >}}">Video Wall</a>.
