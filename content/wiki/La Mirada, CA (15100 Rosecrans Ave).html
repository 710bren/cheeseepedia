<b><i>La Mirada, CA (15100 Rosecrans Ave)</b></i> is a <i>Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza</i> that opened on February 25, 1992 with a [[Cyberamics Road Stage|Road Stage]], and is still open with the 2.0 remodel.

<h2> Stages </h2>
La Mirada opened with a Road Stage with Chuck's tuxedo. There isn't much documentation on their stage, but Chuck's tuxedo was replaced in the 2000s with the Cool Chuck and Avenger outfits. By the end of 2013, Chuck's cap was removed. The stage remained like this until November 2022, when the stage was removed and destroyed for a [[Chuck E. Live Stage (Dance Floor)|Dance Floor]] and [Video Wall]({{< ref "wiki/Video Wall.html" >}}).

<h2> History </h2>
La Mirada opened on February 25, 1992 with a Road Stage and the [[SPT 1988 Remodel Program|1988 remodel]]. There isn't much documentation on La Mirada during the 1988 remodel era. In the mid-late 1990s, they received the 3 [[Phase 1 (1994)|Ph]][[Phase 2 (1997)|as]][[Phase 3 (2000)|es]], removing 1988 remodel decor and remodeled the exterior, as well as installing Skytubes. There isn't much documentation on this era either.

In 2006/2007, La Mirada received the [CEC 2005 Remodel Program]({{< ref "wiki/CEC 2005 Remodel Program.html" >}}), removing all remaining 90s decor, removing showroom walls and balcony seating, painting multiple walls purple, and another exterior remodel. Their Skytubes were removed sometime before 2020. In November 2022, La Mirada received the 2.0 remodel, removing the Road Stage for a Dance Floor and Video Wall. The dome above the entrance was also removed. La Mirada remains like this today.
