**_Santa Ana, CA**_ was a planned _Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre_ for the Santa Ana area in 1979.<ref>PTT Token 134 (B)</ref>

The only evidence of the location's existence comes from a branded token bearing the city's name, PTT Token 134 (B). Notably the token calls it 'Santa Anna'. It is unclear what caused the location to never be built.
