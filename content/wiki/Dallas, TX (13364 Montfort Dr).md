## Stages ##
Originally when the store opened, they had a Studio C Beta, 32M, they would have it for a few years, until Spring 2010, when they would get the Star Stage, this was a test stage meant to update the Studio C concept, they would have it until August of 2012, when they would receive the very first Circles of Light stage, they originally had the 32M Chuck E. that was used on the other stages, but they would remove it sometime in the next month (September 2012) and send the bot to the Port Orange, Florida location, and would use the stage platform as a live show spot, then would also remove the platform sometime later. They would also receive the prototype , also known as the Dance Floor, but they would only have it for a short time. As of September 2022, they still have the COL, albeit without the bot.
