## Trivia: ##

* There was a new promotion that ran with this show. When purchasing a 'Chuck E. Cheese's Value Deal' you would be given red glasses that the 'Decoder Joke' intermissions would have a 'Super Secret Decoder Joke, Use your Glasses to unlock the secret code and laugh away!' The jokes in order were 'What Did the Buffalo say to his son as he was leaving?' 'Bison' Joke 2 was 'What's orange and sounds like a parrot?' 'A Carrot' Joke 3 was 'Why don't monsters eat clowns' 'They taste funny' and the final joke is 'What do you call a sleeping pizza' 'Pizzzza'
