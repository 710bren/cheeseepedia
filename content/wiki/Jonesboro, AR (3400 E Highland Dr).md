**_Jonesboro, AR (3400 E Highland Dr)**_ is a _Chuck E. Cheese's_ that opened on March 29, 2006 with a [Studio C Beta Cappa Mix]({{< ref "wiki/Studio C Beta Cappa Mix.md" >}}){< ref "wiki/Studio C Beta Cappa Mix.md" >}}). This location is the only location in the Northeast Arkansas area. The store received the 2.0 remodel in 2022.

## Stages ##
Jonesboro opened with a [Studio C Beta Cappa Mix]({{< ref "wiki/Studio C Beta Cappa Mix.md" >}}) stage, and [Phase 4]({{< ref "wiki/Phase 4.md" >}}). From 2006 to (at the latest) 2012, the Chuck E. animatronic wore his 'Cool Chuck' outfit. This would later be replaced by the 'Avenger' outfit, which remained on the animatronic up until its removal. Throughout its years of operation, the animatronics would remain in great condition, with its curtains remaining functional until late Spring of 2017, where Chuck E. would begin to run into problems. The eyelid close movement would freeze completely, an issue that was never fixed. After this, air leaks became more common throughout the figure, mainly in its arm raise & head up movements. Its foot tap movement would be disabled around this time, as well. Despite this, the visual appeal and fluidity of the show did not falter until mid 2021, as more of the figure's movements began to deteriorate after a year and a half of no consistent maintenance & operation due to the store's temporary closure in 2020. From this point onwards, Chuck E.'s arm raise movements had mostly deteriorated, only his left forearm capable of raising. His nose movement frequently failed, functioning properly on some days, not functioning at all on others. Chuck E.s eyes would continue to run into problems, with his eyes left movement breaking several times throughout the show's final year of operation. In addition to this, the Studio C show system would also glitch and freeze constantly, leaving Chuck E. and the lighting elements of the show frozen in random, unnatural positions. No maintenance was performed on the show aside from the occasional re-attachment of Chuck E.'s eyelashes. Its final day of full operation was August 2, 2022, as the next day it would be dismantled and removed.

## History ##

### Pre-CEC ###
Milestrip Road's _Discovery Zone_ would open its doors in January of 1994. This location would be the first of three that were established in the Buffalo area, with a second holding its grand opening only six months later on July 9, 1994. Milestrip Road's location would operate for 5 years before _Discovery Zone's_ eventual bankruptcy in 1999, where shortly after being bought by CEC Entertainment, it would reopen as a _Chuck E. Cheese's_ in May 2000.

### Name confusion ###
The store's 'official' name is _Hamburg,_ as it is located in the town of Hamburg, NY. Despite this, it is also known as _Buffalo,_ as it is closer in proximity to the city of Buffalo than it's former sister location, [Amherst, NY (4994 Harlem Rd)]({{< ref "wiki/Amherst, NY (4994 Harlem Rd).md" >}}). The village of Hamburg is within a short distance from another town by the name of _Orchard Park,_ so close that this also causes some confusion as to the store's name.

### Late 2010s expansion/remodel ###
Between the years of 2009-2011, Buffalo received an expansion as well as the 2005 phase 4 remodel. After the store's former neighboring department store had closed, it later expanded into the space, the wall separating the two businesses being knocked down to make room for another 'new' gameroom. This expansion saw the installation of a wheelchair accessible ramp as well as a set of three stairs that lead into the new game area. Although the [Skytubes]({{< ref "wiki/Skytubes.md" >}}) remained during this remodel, they would later be removed in 2014 to be replaced with [Chuck E. Cheese's Fun House]({{< ref "wiki/Chuck E Cheese's Fun House.md" >}}), which would also be removed in 2020.

### 2.0 Remodel ###
Buffalo began their 2.0 remodel in July 2022. Its initial start date was back in December of the previous year, however it was continuously pushed back (December>March>May>July). Instead of the standard 2.0 remodel, Buffalo was granted the 'signature store' title and was given the signature 2.0 remodel package. This included everything that a standard 2.0 would get, as well as the addition of a custom mural featuring the characters exploring Niagara Falls. With this remodel, Buffalo would see their showroom area and kiddie land area swap places, in favor of having the giant video wall visible from outside the building.
