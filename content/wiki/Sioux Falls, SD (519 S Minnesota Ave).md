### <big>History</big> ###
In 1939, a successful grocery company called **Red Owl** was expanding and chose to have their third location be at _519 S Minnesota Ave in Sioux Falls, South Dakota_. This store was seen as very successful and 20 years later it got a major expansion to the building. In 1976 the then property owner _Merle Getten_ decided to rebrand the store into **Country Store**, a concept where customers could save money by bagging their own groceries and taking them out to their own cars. This concept wasn't very successful and the business sold out to _Kampgrounds of America Inc_ in 1977.


KOA then remodeled the property again and started an experimental business called **Granny's Ice Cream Parlour and Family Fun Center**. The concept included an arcade, bumper cars, pinball machines, batting cages, and mini golf. This concept however didn't take off the way KOA had hoped and in 1982, KOA sold the business to a firm called _Advance-Carter Co_. ACC decided to use the property to expand their arcade chain called **The Circus**.<ref>https://www.newspapers.com/image/328257116/?clipping_id=148026669</ref> This concept however didn't last too long and by 1986, the business was sold to **Galaxy Enterprises Inc** owners **Randy Hindbjorgen, Chris Kirkus, Randy Koepsell, and Doug McBeth**, who used it as the first Piccadilly Circus franchise location. This would later become the most fondly remembered Gigglebee's location.
