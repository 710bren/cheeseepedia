The **_Winchester Warblettes Nameplate**_ made its first and only appearance at the first Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre on  located in the Town & Country Shopping Center in San Jose, California; where it took the role of identifying the Winchester Warblettes Animatronic. 

## Production ##
Production on the Winchester Warblettes nameplate is almost non-existent outside of speculation, we can assume it was produced between March 1977 through May 1977 in a single batch with all the other Winchester nameplates by either the Fantasy Forest Manufacturing company or Atari Incorporated, most likely the former.

## Usage ##
The only usage of the nameplate appeared at the first Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre on 370 South Winchester Boulevard in San Jose, where it was placed on the Warblettes platform facing the main Band Board wall from May 1977 to possibly 1981, where it had a chance to be switched out for the more 'modern' counterpart seen in stores from the era.

## Design ##
Like all the other Winchester nameplates, the Warblettes nameplate used a rounded wooden base with the white text 'WARBLETTES' placed in a yellow border surrounding the text. It is not known if Pizza Time Theatre Inc placed their copyright on the plate like they had done with the other nameplates in late 1979.
