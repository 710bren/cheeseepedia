The **_Chuck Statue- Liberace**_ was a [[Artifact Shelves]] item created for Chuck E. Cheese's locations around 1994-1995.

## Production## 
The statue would be produced by _Peeler Rose Productions_ for the [\2](\1), [\2](\1), [\2](\1), [\2](\1), [\2](\1), [\2](\1), [\2](\1), [\2](\1), and [\2](\1) statues. However, unlike the other statues, this one was produced as one single piece.

The statue was likely produced out of chalkware, simiarly to Esco statues, which the shelves also used. The statue was painted with Cel Vinyl.

## Design## 
Unlike other statues produced, this one does not use any fabric similarly to the [\2](\1). His head is larger than his body to mimic the designs of Esco Statues.
