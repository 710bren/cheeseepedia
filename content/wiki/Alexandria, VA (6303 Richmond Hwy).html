<b><i>6303 Richmond Hwy, Store #72</b></i> was a <i>Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre</i> that opened on September 20, 1982, with a [[Cyberamics Balcony Stage|Balcony Stage]] and closed between November and December 2009 (day unknown), with a [2-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/2-Stage.html" >}}).

It was originally located next to a Kmart which opened on March 22nd, 1973, and closed in 1988 (Day and month unknown) when it was relocated to 7704 Richmond Hwy.<ref>https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bQbJ704l5I8hkf4hUNa7IyYzGW5I3CIBYmqigrRLD7g/edit?pli=1&gid=332535324#gid=332535324</ref> Alexandria was also located in the Kings Crossing Shopping Center.

<h2>Stages</h2>
Originally, this location opened with the Balcony Stage. Sadly there are rarely any pictures and no videos of Alexandria back then. They received Chuck E.'s House Facade in around 1989/1990 and the 2-Stage in the Early 90's. The bots would eventually be replaced with [[Herndon, VA (2465 Centreville Rd)|Herndon, VA's]] bots between 2005-2007. They would later replace the Tuxedo with the Avenger outfit before closing between November and December 2009.

<h2>History </h2>
Alexandria opened on September 20th, 1982, with the Balcony Stage. Alexandria then received the 1988 remodel around 1989/1990 which removed the Balcony Stage for Chuck E.'s House Facade and removed all PTT decor and an exterior change. Then the Kmart closed in 1988.  Between 1992-1993, Alexandria received another remodel which involved another exterior change, the addition of newer decor such as the record posters, and the removal of Chuck E.'s House Facade for the 2-Stage. In the mid to late 90's, the location received another exterior change received skytubes, and removed the ball pit.  At an unknown point in 1997, the area was sold and bought by the corporation. In 2005, both of the 2 stages curtains were disabled. Between 2005 - 2007, Alexandria Virginias original cyberamics were replaced with Herndon Virginias cyberamics. In 2007, michael Jackson visited the Alexandria Virginia location. in the late 2000s, chuck es tuxedo outfit was replaced with the avenger outfit.

Alexandria remained like this until their closure between November and December 2009. They closed because it was located near the abandoned Kmart which closed in 1988 (Which relocated to a former Thieves Market building which then closed sometime in 2000) and also because the plaza was dying and CEC wanted a fresh start for the location. After that, the old shopping center was redeveloped into a Walmart in 2010. After the CEC got redeveloped, the Chuck E. Cheese reopened on November 20th, 2010, this time on [[Alexandria, VA (6301 Richmond Hwy)|6301 Richmond Hwy]]. As of February 2023, the former Chuck E. Cheese remains a part of a Walmart, and the new Chuck E. Cheese moved one space to the left.
