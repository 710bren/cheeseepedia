**_Showbiz Pizza Place**_ was a FEC chain that was founded on March 3, 1980 in [Kansas City, Missouri]({{< ref "wiki/Kansas City, MO (2726 NE Vivion Rd).md" >}}), and was defunct by March 1993 (day unknown) due to [Concept Unification]({{< ref "wiki/Concept Unification.md" >}}). Showbiz was known for the Rock-afire Explosion, a band created by Aaron Fechter of Creative Engineering. Showbiz had a total of 248 locations ever opened, with the last one being in [Richmond, Virginia]({{< ref "wiki/Richmond, VA (10430 Midlothian Turnpike).md" >}}). 

## Prehistory (1979-1980) ##
As Pizza Time Theatre began offering franchises, it attracted Robert L. Brock the founder of SPP, and in June 1979, Nolan Bushnell and Brock signed an agreement to open as many of 280 locations in 16 states. In late 1979, he noticed other companies making more advanced animatronics, especially Creative Engineering. By December, Showbiz Pizza Place Inc., giving birth to the Showbiz Pizza name. Months later, the first location opened in Kansas City.

## Rise of Showbiz (1980-1984/1985) ##
Instead of the Rock-afire Explosion (which was still in development) they had the Wolf Pack 5, which debuted in 1978 at IAAPA. Instantly after opening, Showbiz Pizza was sued by Nolan Bushnell over a contract breach. The judge ruled in favor of Pizza Time Theatre in March 1980, forcing SPP to pay some profits to them. Showbiz then proceeded to open over 200 locations throughout 1980 and 1984, marking a very successful chain, and ultimately became a rival of Chuck E. Cheese. According to a training video dating 1991, they would open location MILES from each other. By 1983, they were at their peak, but later that year, they began to slow down, and by Q4 1983, Showbiz was forced to close a location for the first time, which was in Abilene, Texas. Between 1984 and 1985, they were forced to close down so many locations. Their only possible decision at this point was to purchase their long time rival, Pizza Time Theatre in May 1985, which declared bankruptcy a year prior on March 28, 1984.

## Formation of Showbiz Pizza Time Inc. (1986-November 1989) ##
[[File:ShowBiz Pizza 1989 Logo.svg|thumb|Showbiz Pizza's logo used from 1986 until the end of Concept Unification.]]
In late 1985, both companies were getting ready to merge. More locations were opened, and by early 1986, Showbiz Pizza Time Inc. was formed. As a result, ties began to sour with SPT and CEI. The CEI 1986 Liberty Tape Party proved this, and as a result, SPT suspended CEI from the entertainment division until Fall 1987. Chuck E. Cheese himself began appearing at restaurants as well. They retrofitted some locations with [Chuck E.'s House]({{< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House.md" >}}), and this proved to be popular. As a result, a prototype CU stage was created in 1988/1989, but was rejected by executives. By November 1989, Showbiz Pizza Time Inc. completely cut ties with Creative Engineering, and Concept Unification had begun.

## Concept Unification and Aftermath (November 1989-March 1993/Today) ##
The first location to receive Concept Unification was [Dallas, TX]({{< ref "wiki/Dallas, TX (13125 Montfort Dr).md" >}}) location in November 1989. Concept Unification involved changing the Rock-afire Explosion to the 3-Stage, removing all traces of Showbiz, and changing the place's name to Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza. Over 150 locations were affected, and by March 1993, the final location had reopened as a Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza, ending Showbiz Pizza's 13 year history. By later in 1993, Showbiz Pizza Time Inc. finalized Concept Unification, making the name 'Showbiz Pizza' extinct. The Rock-afire Explosion's story, however, was not over yet. They began to appear in other FECs like Pistol Pete's Pizza, Billy Bob's (which were basically 3-Stages converted back to RAEs), and Billy Bob's Wonderland. Most of these however closed, and Billy Bob's Wonderland has the very last public RAE in operation.
