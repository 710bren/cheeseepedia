The **Studio C Cappa** is a stage format found at Chuck E. Cheese's locations which either opened with the stage or replaced a previous stage from 2003-2006. It is a downgraded version of the Studio C Beta, 16m, which is a small downgrade from the 32m Beta, which is a downgrade from the Studio C Alpha. There were about either 63 or 64 Cappas installed, and as of August 2022, only 33 remain.

##  History ## 
The Studio C concept debuted in December of 1997 at the [\2](\1) location, where the Studio C Alpha debuted. Alphas continued to be installed until 2002, when the Burlington, New Jersey location opened, then the Studio C Beta, which debuted in the Fall of 2000, became the main stage type, then, starting in 2003, the Beta was downgraded, but only with the animatronic, from 32 movements, to 16 movements. Starting in the Summer of 2003 CEC Entertainment downgraded the Beta once again, this time to the Studio C Cappa, keeping the 16m animatronic, but with a new mirror background (only the first 7 'Version 1' Cappas received this) and a front with a larger Blue Screen in the middle. In November of 2003, the Tuscaloosa Alabama location opened, being the first 'Version 2' Cappa, with many more locations receiving this design, such as [\2](\1). the design would stay the same until around late 2004 to early 2005, when the 'Version 3' would be released, with the Lewisville, Texas location being the first to receive this design. this design is basically the same as the 'Version 2' design with the Blue Screen front being the same, but with the stage and backdrop from a Studio C Beta. This would be the final design of the Studio C Cappa, as they stopped production of them in 2006, afterwards, they would continue to produce Studio C Beta, 16m's.
