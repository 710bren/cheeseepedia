## History ##

East Hanover opened on 1994 as a Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza with a 1-Stage. Due to New Jersey gambling laws, the store opened without any ticket redemption system or skee-ball type games. 

East Hanover remodeled to the update of the [2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative]({{< ref "wiki/2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration  Major Remodel Initiative.md" >}}) in 2009. During the '09 remodel, Chuck E. Cheese's opened a lease on the adjacent storefront, and the wall separating Chuck E. Cheese's and the next-door property was removed, along with the existing merchandise closest. This nearly doubled the unit's square-footage. Tickets and redemption games were also added under the New Jersey Tickets Per Token System. The store was also slotted to receive a used [Circles of Light]({{< ref "wiki/Circles of Light.md" >}}) stage in 2017, presumptively from the [Wilmington, DE (3601 Silverside Rd)]({{< ref "wiki/Wilmington, DE (3601 Silverside Rd).md" >}}){< ref "wiki/Wilmington, DE (3601 Silverside Rd).md" >}}) store. This was cancelled upon the announcement of the 2.0 test concept.

The store was remodeled again to 2.0 in October 2022. The store's of June 2023, East Hanover still has the 2.0 Remodel & 2021 Model Dance Floor + Video Wall.

The 2.0 remodel retained East Hanover's existing front doors, cashwrap countertops, salad bars, soda machines, and back-of-house equipment. New paint, signage, ticket blaster, carpeting, and other common 2.0 features were installed.
