<p><h2>History </h2></p>
<p>Concepci贸n opened on August 18, 2012 as the first CEC to open in the Rockstar era, as well as the last location to open with a Studio C Beta. It had the 2010 update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative, which included some 2000s and early 2010s decor, Skytubes, and of course, the Studio C Beta. The exterior began to deteriorate after a while, with one of the sides having letters almost falling off, and the 2005 logo being vandalized, but this may have been fixed. As of July 2023, Concepci贸n remains open to this day, along with the 2010 update and the Studio C Beta.</p>
