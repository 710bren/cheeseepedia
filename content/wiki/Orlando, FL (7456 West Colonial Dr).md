##History##
Orlando (West) opened on November 12th, 1998, as a corporate-owned location. Orlando (West) opened with the Studio C Alpha stage and also featured, some checkers around the store, and some late 90's decor, Toddler Zone, and SkyTubes. Orlando (West) remained like this until in 2006-2007, when they received the 2005 update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative which involved the removal of the showroom walls, removing older decor for newer decor, & adding purple walls. In around the Mid-Late 2010's, the purple and red awnings were removed from the building. Sometime in 2021, Chuck's head was replaced with the head from the [7419 International Dr]({{< ref "wiki/Orlando, FL (7419 International Dr).md" >}}) location after they got the 2.0 Remodel. On April 17th, 2023, West Orlando would start their 2017 2.0 Remodel Program (2.0 Remodel) which involves the removal of the Studio C Alpha for a 2021 Model Dance Floor & Video Wall; making all Orlando stores botless, a day after Orlando, FL (449 N Alafaya Trail) (East Orlando) removed theirs a day earlier. The store's Grand Reopening took place on May 18th, 2023; just a day after Orlando, FL (449 N Alafaya Trail) (East Orlando)'s Grand Reopening which was on CEC's 46th Anniversary.

Originally, when the store opened, the location had a Studio C Alpha stage like every other store opening at the time until it was removed on April 17th, 2023, for a 2021 Model Dance Floor & Video Wall.
