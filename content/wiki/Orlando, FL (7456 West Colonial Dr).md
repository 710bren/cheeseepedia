##History##
Orlando (West) opened on November 12th, 1998 as a corporate-owned location. Orlando (West) opened with the Studio C Alpha stage and also featured, some checkers around the store, and some late 90's decor, Toddler Zone, and SkyTubes. Orlando (West) remained like this until in 2006-2007, when they received the 2005 remodel (Phase 4) which involved the removal of the showroom walls, removing older decor for newer decor, relocating the Alpha stage, & adding purple walls. Orlando (West) still remains like this. Currently, as of March 2023, the location still has the 2005 remodal and the Alpha stage.
