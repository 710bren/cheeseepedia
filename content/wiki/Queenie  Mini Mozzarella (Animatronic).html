<b><i>Queenie / Mini Mozzarella</b></i> was an animatronic created for the [Wolf Pack 5]({{< ref "wiki/Wolf Pack 5.html" >}}) show and debuted at the 1978 IAAPA.

She uses the same mask mold as [[Grandma Bear (Animatronic)|Grandma Bear]]/Beatrice from the [Bear Country Jubilee]({{< ref "wiki/Bear Country Jubilee.html" >}}) and a nearly identical mech as Mama Grandbags from the [Hard Luck Bears]({{< ref "wiki/Hard Luck Bears.html" >}}).

<h2> History </h2>
During the creation of the [[Rock-afire Explosion|Rock Afire Explosion]] in 1980, Queenie was going to be reused as a character much like the rest of the Wolf Pack 5. However, marketing executive for [[ShowBiz Pizza Place|Showbiz Pizza Place]], Stan Emmerson suggested replacing her with a mouse to go with the pizza theme and because [Pizza Time Theatre]({{< ref "wiki/Pizza Time Theatre.html" >}}) and Disney both had mouse mascots. In an attempt to not come off as arrogant, Aaron Fetcher allowed for Queenie to be converted into Mini Mozzarella.<ref>https://youtu.be/0l6-6ewuY70?si=Y5rDQN6zixww5rJC&t=452</ref>

<h2> Design </h2>
Queenie is a red fox positioned on the far right of the stage. At the 1978 IAAPA, she wore a dark blue scarf, light blue button-up shirt, black jeans, and black and white saddle shoes. After the 1979 IAAPA, she wore a white shirt, skirt with various colors depending on location, black and white saddle shoes, and a rose in her right hand. This would become the standard design. During her conversion to Mini, she would be given a mouse tail.
