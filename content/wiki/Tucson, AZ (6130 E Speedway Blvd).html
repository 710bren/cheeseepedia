<b><i>6130 E Speedway Blvd, Store #217/3197</b></i> was a Chuck E. Cheese's location in Tucson, Arizona. The store opened in April 1995 as a standalone building in the Monterey Village Shopping Center with a [1-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/1-Stage.html" >}}) and was relocated to [Tucson, AZ (6125 E Speedway Blvd)]({{< ref "wiki/Tucson, AZ (6125 E Speedway Blvd).html" >}}) in October 2014 with a [[Circles of Light|Circles of Light, 16m]] and still operates to this day.

This is not to be confused with the [Tucson, AZ (5534 E 22nd St)]({{< ref "wiki/Tucson, AZ (5534 E 22nd St).html" >}}) Pizza Time Theatre that opened July 15th, 1980, and closed in 1987 with a Portrait Stage. This is also not to be confused with the [Tucson, AZ (8616 E Broadway Blvd)]({{< ref "wiki/Tucson, AZ (8616 E Broadway Blvd).html" >}}) Pizza Time Theatre that opened on May 4th, 1981, and closed in 1983 with a [[Cyberamics Balcony Stage|Balcony Stage]].

<h2> Stages </h2>
When this store opened in 1995, they opened with a [1-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/1-Stage.html" >}}). They would keep this 1-Stage until closure. It was the only one in Arizona and had a turntable until closure.

<h2> History</h2>
Before the store's development began, the store was a movie theater called Cineworld 4 Theatre which opened on May 5th, 1971, and was closed around October 1994<ref>http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/28610</ref> with the conversion to CEC starting not long after its closure.

Tucson opened in April 1995 (After an almost 8-year hiatus from the city) with a [1-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/1-Stage.html" >}}) with a turntable. This was Arizona's only 1-Stage. In around the Mid 2000's the store would receive an exterior repaint and a minor remodel. It would remain this way until the store's closure in October 2014 (After almost 20 years of operation, outlasting both of the city's Pizza Time Theatre stores) when it relocated across the street to [[Tucson, AZ (6125 E Speedway Blvd)|6125 E Speedway Blvd]] with a [[Circles of Light|Circles of Light, 16m]] which still operates to this day, albeit without the bot.

After the store closed and moved, the location would remain vacant for a while until a gym called 'Tucson Strength' took over which interestingly kept the exterior intact except for a repaint of the building and changes to the store's interior.
