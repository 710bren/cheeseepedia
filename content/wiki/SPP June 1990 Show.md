{{Showtape|date=June 1990|raesvhs=y}}

**_SPP June 1990 Show**_ is one of the last few showtapes released for _Showbiz Pizza Place's_ hosting the _Rock-afire Explosion_.

For some stores, this was the last tape used before _Concept Unification_ would start at their location. Each tape sent after [SPP Christmas '89 / Wave Bday]({{< ref "wiki/SPP Christmas '89  Wave Bday.md" >}}) would become increasingly more rare as stores would convert to _3-Stages._ It was also the final showtape to feature any new _Rock-afire Explosion_ material from CEI as Friends, and Rock & Roll Tribute were the last segments they've released. In September 1990 they released Best Of 1 out of 5 in a series of compilation tapes, _Showbiz Pizza Place_ locations would play them until then.
