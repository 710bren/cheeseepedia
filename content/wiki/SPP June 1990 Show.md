<b><i>SPP June 1990 Show</b></i> is one of the last few showtapes released for <i>Showbiz Pizza Place's</i> hosting the <i>Rock-afire Explosion</i>.

For some stores, this was the last tape used before <i>Concept Unification</i> would start at their location. Each tape sent after [SPP Christmas '89 / Wave Bday]({{< ref "wiki/SPP Christmas '89  Wave Bday.md" >}}) would become increasingly more rare as stores would convert to <i>3-Stages.</i> 

It was also the final showtape to feature any new <i>Rock-afire Explosion</i> material from CEI as Friends, and Rock & Roll Tribute were the last segments they've released. 

In September 1990 they released [SPP Best Of 1 Kids/Friends]({{< ref "wiki/SPP Best Of 1 KidsFriends.md" >}}) out of 5 in a series of compilation tapes, <i>Showbiz Pizza Place</i> locations would play them until that store received <i>Concept Unification</i>.
