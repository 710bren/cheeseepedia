<b><i>2520 E Lake Mead Blvd</b></i> was a <i>Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre</i> in North Las Vegas, Nevada. The store opened in October 1982 and closed sometime in 1984. This was one of three Pizza Time Theatres in the Las Vegas area, the other two being Las Vegas, NV (3430 E Tropicana Ave) which also closed in 1984 (Opened Sometime in 1982 with an unknown month and day) & Las Vegas, NV (4750 Vegas Dr) which opened in 1982 with an unknown day and month. Both stores also housed a Balcony Stage.

<h2> History </h2>
North Las Vegas opened in October 1982 and closed sometime in 1984 with a [Balcony Stage]({{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage.md" >}}).

The store was then closed in 1984 for unknown reasons (though it may have been underperforming, a reason for many store closures around the same time) after operating for almost 2 years. The show's fate is unknown.
