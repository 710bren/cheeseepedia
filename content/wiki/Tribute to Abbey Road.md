## Trivia ##

* This show was the first to feature Shalisa Sloan as the voice of Mitzi. She was only 11-years-old when she got the part.
* This show was also the first to feature Rick Bailey as a lead vocalist, although not as Beach Bear, but as the Moon in 'Golden Slumbers'. Previously, he had done instrumental work and back-up vocals for the band, but this is his first time singing lead. He would end up replacing Aaron Fechter as the voice of Beach Bear in the following showtape, [RAE Christmas '82]({{< ref "wiki/RAE Christmas '82.md" >}}).
* This is Aaron Fechter's final show recording any new vocals for Beach Bear. Anytime his Beach Bear voice is heard following this tape, it's through reused segments.
* 'Louisiana' is an original song by the voice of Fatz, Burt 'Sal' Wilson.
* 'Child of the' Rock is an original song by the voice of Dook, Duke Chauppetta.
* 'Goofy Gas' is an original song by the voice of Uncle Klunk, Jeff 'Claude' Howell
* All of the segments from this showtape would go on to be reused in future compilation tapes.
* At the time of it's release, the Abbey Road Medley was the longest individual segment on a Rock-afire showtape, clocking in at 14-minutes. This title has since been taken by longer tracks, however.
