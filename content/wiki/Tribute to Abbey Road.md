## Production ##
When producing the _Abbey Road_ segment, CEI rented 23 musicians to perform additional instruments, specifically listed are the horns and strings. During _Louisiana,_ CEI moved their drums into a warehouse for recording to provide proper reverberation. _Child of the Rock_ has 15 children from a local elementary school provide the backup vocals.<ref name=':1' />

Three songs on the tape would be original productions by The Noize. _Louisiana_ would be written by Burt 'Sal' Wilson, _Child of the Rock_ would be written by Duke Chauppetta, and _Goofy Gas_ by Jeff 'Claude' Howell.<ref name=':0' />

The showtape would be completed in late August.<ref name=':1' />

## Trivia ##

* This show was the first to feature Shalisa Sloan as the voice of Mitzi. She was only 11-years-old when she got the part.
* This show was also the first to feature Rick Bailey as a lead vocalist, although not as Beach Bear, but as the Moon in 'Golden Slumbers'. Previously, he had done instrumental work and back-up vocals for the band, but this is his first time singing lead. He would end up replacing Aaron Fechter as the voice of Beach Bear in the following showtape, [RAE Christmas '82]({{< ref "wiki/RAE Christmas '82.md" >}}).
* This is Aaron Fechter's final show recording any new vocals for Beach Bear. Anytime his Beach Bear voice is heard following this tape, it's through reused segments.
* All of the segments from this showtape would go on to be reused in future compilation tapes.
* At the time of it's release, the Abbey Road Medley was the longest individual segment on a Rock-afire showtape, clocking in at 14-minutes. This title has since been taken by longer tracks, however.
