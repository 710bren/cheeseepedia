##History##
Efforts to modernize the original building had been in the works for several years, with discussions about a [CEC 2005 Remodel Program]({{< ref "wiki/CEC 2005 Remodel Program.md" >}}) for the store gaining momentum in the early 2010s. Plans to completely revamp the store's site had been in motion since July 7th, 2011, and by 2012, they had officially decided to close the existing location and rebuild it in the same spot, incorporating the new remodel. The decision to do so stemmed from concerns about the store's layout and the aging condition of the building, leading them to opt for a complete teardown and a fresh start. The original building shuttered its doors on April 15th, 2012, and shortly thereafter, it was demolished. The new store was built over the summer season, and officially opened on November 14th, 2012. Springfield remained like this until Summer 2024, When they received the 2.0 remodel with the removal of the Animatronic for a Dance Floor. It's likely they kept the Circles of Lights stage.  The grand reopening occurred on August 14th, 2024.
