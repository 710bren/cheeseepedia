## History ##
Murray opened on March 17, 1983 as a Showbiz Pizza Place with . Unfortunately, there isn't a ton of information on Murray as a Showbiz Pizza, or in general. In the late 80s, Murray received the 1988 remodel, changing the decor, added checkers around the store, changed the exterior, and other things. In around 1991, Murray received Concept Unification, removing the Rock-afire for a 3-Stage and changed the exterior again. Murray remained like this until July 1997 (day unknown), when they would permanently close for unknown reasons. After closure, they became a buffet named Paradise Buffet, strangely keeping the road sign. As of August 2023, Paradise Buffet remains on the space.
