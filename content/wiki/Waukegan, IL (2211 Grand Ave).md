**_2211 Grand Ave**_ was a Pizza Time Theatre that opened in Early 1983 with a Balcony Stage, and closed as a Chuck E. Cheeseâ€™s Pizza in January 1997 with a 2-Stage.

## Stages## 
Waukegan opened with a Balcony Stage. In 1989-1990, they received a C Stage. In Late 1994-Early 1994, Waukegan would receive a 2-Stage, this being their final stage.

## History## 
Not much is known about Waukegan other than the facts previously stated. It can be assumed that their lounge act was The King, like most new PTTs at the time.
Waukegan closed in January 1997, followed by an auction on January 25th. Their show was sent to Fairview Heights, Illinois, where it was installed and used up until Fairview Heights got 2.0 in 2019.

##  Animatronics ## 
After Waukegan closed in January 1997, their show was excluded from the auction. This was because it was sent to Fairview Heights, Illinois to replace their 3-Stage in 1997-2005.
