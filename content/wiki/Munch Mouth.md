<b><i>Munch Mouth</b></i> is an arcade machine used in [Pizza Time Theatre]({{< ref "wiki/Pizza Time Theatre.md" >}}).

The gameplay is unknown, but from the photo we have it seems like you would shoot balls into munch's teeth knocking them down one by one. there was also likely a score to like other games of this type and a timer that would count down to 0.
