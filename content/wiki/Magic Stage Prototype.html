<p>The <i>Magic Stage</i> was a test stage made by Showbiz Pizza Place with the objective to stray away from Rock-afire Explosion branding as a result of licensing conflicts between Creative Engineering and Showbiz Pizza.</p>
<p><h2> History </h2></p>
<p>The magic stage was installed in November of 1985 at only one location- most likely at the Longview, TX (1905 W Loop 281) Showbiz Pizza Place. Contrary to popular assumption, the showtape created for the magic stage actually had no correlation with the magic night showtape released in 1984. Christmas songs were reused with an added custom countdown and introduction by an off-stage announcer before each song.</p>
<p><h3> Austin, TX (8038 Burnet Rd) </h3></p>
<p>Sometime later, the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Austin, TX (8038 Burnet Rd)" >}}">Austin, TX (8038 Burnet Rd)</a> Showbiz Pizza Place would obtain the magic stage cosmetics. The stage was outfitted with each character costume and the valance (minus the 'MAGIC' lettering) until Concept Unification.</p>
<p><h2> Design </h2></p>
<p>The design of the stage was very different than most Rock afire stages. All characters had a color pattern of gold, black, and white. The background of the stage was 2 treble clefs and lights. The top of the stage was completely altered to be entirely black with the word 'MAGIC' above the stage. Billy Bob and Looney Bird's stage had pictures of different bands, a brick wall behind the characters and a disk that said, 'We've got the beat!'</p>
<p><h3> Billy Bob and Looney Bird </h3></p>
<p>Billy Bob had a cowboy hat, a white collar, a blue and white striped pants, a black bowtie and black shoes. We still don't know the appearance of Looney Bird, but we do know that he no longer had his green leaves and is now in a plain grey tin can.</p>
<p><h3> Mitzi Mozzarella, Beach Bear, Fatz Geronimo, Choo Choo, Dook </h3></p>
<p>Mitzi wore a tuxedo, a golden dress and held a wand. Beach Bear worse a small top hat and a tuxedo, while retaining his guitar. Fatz was only slightly changed, now wearing a tie and a golden top hat. Choo Choo wore a golden derby. Dook wore a similar hat to Choo Choo, and a similar tuxedo to Beach Bear. Dooks drum front was changed to read 'We've Got the Beat!', and his drum base was repainted black and white.</p>
<p><h3> Rolfe Dewolfe and Earl Schmerle </h3></p>
<p>Rolfe wore a large tuxedo and a small tophat. Earl wore black pants, a sleeveless tuxedo, and a black party hat. They stood next to a primarily pink jukebox. Golden streamers and black music notes would replace Rolfes former backdrop.</p>
