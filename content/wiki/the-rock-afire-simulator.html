<b><i>The Rock-afire Simulator</b></i> is an in-development official Creative Engineering animatronics simulator, set to be released in 2025 or 2026.
<h2>History</h2> 
The simulator would be a successor project to {{< wiki-link "The Rock-afire Explosion Simulator" >}} from 2020, which was a Kickstarter project that did not receive its required funding due to the prior fangame release of {{< wiki-link "Rock-afire Replay" >}} taking the spotlight from the project. While the initial development would cease around early 2021, Creative Engineering would still tout wanting to eventually have an official simulator.
<br>
Communication over the successor project would begin with CEI and its soon to be lead, BattleXGamer2, would begin in late 2022. Unofficial plans and prototyping would begin in early 2023, with things being officially set into motion by 2024. Showcases of the simulator have appeared on the 

 program developed in Unreal Engine designed to allow users to both view The Rock-afire Explosion's original showtapes and program new showtapes for The Rock-afire Explosion. The simulator is currently in a work in progress state and is expected to release sometime in 2025 or 2026. It is being worked on in collaboration with Creative Engineering Inc to attempt to accurately represent The Rock-afire Explosion digitally.
