The Rock-afire Simulator is a program developed in Unreal Engine designed to allow users to both view The Rock-afire Explosion's original showtapes and program new showtapes for The Rock-afire Explosion. The simulator is currently in a work in progress state and is expected to release sometime in 2025 or 2026. It is being worked on in collaboration with Creative Engineering Inc to attempt to accurately represent The Rock-afire Explosion digitally.
