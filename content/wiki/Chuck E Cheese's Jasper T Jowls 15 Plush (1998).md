**Story**
     In 1998, Chuck E. Cheese released a line of plush toys that included Chuck E. Cheese, Pasqually P. Pieplate, Mr. Munch, and Jasper T. Jowls. The most popular variant of this set is 
     the 9' line, but there must've been a 14' line as a 14' Jasper T. Jowls plush was bought by user BeetleSap in January. 

**Description**
     This plush has a wide head, snout that covers face from the front, is missing his shirt, and resembles a hillbilly, just like his older counterparts. Noticeably bulky with plastic 
     eyes and a hard, oval nose.

**Extra info**
     The Jasper plush seen in the photos below was sold by paul_p123 on eBay. Near perfect quality, almost as if it was never touched. This was the only listing on eBay for a 14' 
     1998 Jasper T. Jowls plush as of February, 2023. Paul stated the plush was from 1988, however this may have been a typo
