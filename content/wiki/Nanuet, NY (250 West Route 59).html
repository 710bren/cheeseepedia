<p><b><i>Nanuet, NY (250 West Route 59), Store #849</b></i> is a Chuck E. Cheese's that opened on December 20th, 2003 with a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Studio C Beta" >}}">Studio C Beta</a> <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Chuck E Cheese 16m (Animatronic)" >}}">16m</a>, and is still open to this day.</p>
<p>This store is one of the 5 stores selected for the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/CEC Legacy Locations" >}}">CEC Legacy Location</a>, planning to keep its animatronic stage even after its <a href="{{< ref "wiki/CEC 2018 20 Remodel Program" >}}">CEC 2018 2.0 Remodel.</a></p>
<p><h2> History </h2></p>
<p>The store would open with the SPT 1992/1993 Remodel Program, later updating the store with pieces of art from the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/CEC 2005 Remodel Program" >}}">CEC 2005 Remodel Program</a>. Its exterior would be updated to Rockstar Chuck in the 2010s.</p>
<p>On May 11, 2024, The New York Times confirmed that Nanuet was selected as one of the locations to retain their animatronic show after <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Northridge, CA (8425 Reseda Blvd)" >}}">Northridge, CA</a> was selected in 2023.<sup>[1]</sup> This was controversial within the community as it was assumed that CEC Entertainment had chose this location for the sole purpose of fulfilling an East Coast retro store concept as this location is the closest one to the New York City metro area until weeks after where they would announce that three other stages would remain. On June 12, 2024, the store began its retro store remodel, receiving a 2019 Model Dance Floor with no Video Wall.  The store would also keep the majority of its older art from 1992 and 2005 remodels.</p>
<p>The Grand Reopening would be held on July 18, 2024 with Avenger Chuck making an Appearance at the store.</p>
<p><h2> Stages </h2></p>
<p>This store opened housing a Studio C 2000 (Beta) with a 16 movement Garner Holt Productions Chuck E. Cheese Animatronic wearing the 'Cool Chuck' outfit this outfit would be partially replaced with the 'Avenger Chuck' shirt sometime in the late 2000's - Early 2010's (the hat also being replaced sometime in the early 2010's as well), the curtains became disabled in fall of 2011 and the TV's also got replaced with 3 LG TV's of the same size that they still have to this day. the 'Cool' shorts and rest of the 'Avenger' outfit would be replaced sometime around 2015-16, because of the exterior sign change. The bluescreen and camera were removed sometime in 2013 (replaced with a Ticket Blaster mural) along with dim lighting, the 'STUDIO C' sign was moved to above the TV's following the removal of the bluescreen and camera. In August of 2024, the bot was replaced with another 16m bot in better condition than the previous one. The new bot also has full Avenger attire including the hat.</p>
