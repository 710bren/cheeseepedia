<h2> History </h2>
Cherry Hill opened on August 25, 1992 with a [2-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/2-Stage.md" >}}). The store would receive the [CEC 2005 Remodel Program]({{< ref "wiki/CEC 2005 Remodel Program.md" >}}) in 2007. In 2023, the store would receive the CEC 2018 2.0 Remodel Program (2.0 remodel). On October 12, 2023, the store held its grand re-opening. 

<h2> Stages </h2>
Sometime around 2009-2010, Chuck E. would get the Avenger hat and shirt. The hat was removed in 2013. Jasper and Helen received new masks in late 2014. Chuck E. received the Rockstar shirt in early 2015 and finally the jeans in March 2017. It would remain like this until August 2023, when they received the 2.0 remodel and removed the 2-Stage.
