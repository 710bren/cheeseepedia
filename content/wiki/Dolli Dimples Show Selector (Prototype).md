The **_Dolli Dimples Show Selector**_ (no official name given) is a prototype selection unit for the [\2](\1).

##  History ## 
Shortly after [\2](\1) was installed at [[San Jose, CA (1371 Kooser Rd)]], Pizza Time Theatre prototyped for an alteration to Dolli's show playback to have a jukebox unit that could have coins inserted into it to play specific shows. The single prototype box would be moved throughout the early corporate offices before eventually being thrown in a scrap pile at the [[Pizza Time Theatre Sunnyvale, CA Corporate Office]]. Dale Benjamin would recover the box and keep it with them till present day.<ref>[[:File:ReferencefacebookpostDDShowSelector.png]]</ref>
