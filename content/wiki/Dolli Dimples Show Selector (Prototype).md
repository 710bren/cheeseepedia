The <b><i>Dolli Dimples Show Selector</b></i> (no official name given) is a prototype selection unit for the [Kooser Dolli Dimples Animatronic]({{< ref "wiki/Kooser Dolli Dimples (Animatronic).md" >}}).

<h2> History </h2>
Shortly after [Kooser Dolli Dimples]({{< ref "wiki/Kooser Dolli Dimples (Animatronic).md" >}}) was installed at [San Jose, CA (1371 Kooser Rd)]({{< ref "wiki/San Jose, CA (1371 Kooser Rd).md" >}}), Pizza Time Theatre prototyped for an alteration to Dolli's show playback to have a jukebox unit that could have coins inserted into it to play specific shows. The single prototype box would be moved throughout the early corporate offices before eventually being thrown in a scrap pile at the [Pizza Time Theatre Sunnyvale, CA Corporate Office]({{< ref "wiki/Pizza Time Theatre Sunnyvale, CA Corporate Office.md" >}}). Dale Benjamin would recover the box and keep it with them till present day.<ref></ref>
