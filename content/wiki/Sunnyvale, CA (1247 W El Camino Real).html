In Winter of 1982, Joan Nelson, area representative for the then Marketing Sales Representative Program, had a near 50 person group scheduled to visit the store. Upon arriving, the store's power had cut out. Instead of turning the group away, Joan had the employees light up ash-trays and candles around the store. The group was served food and employees dressed up in multiple walkarounds singing Christmas carols to entertain the guests.<ref name=':3'>https://archive.org/details/the-pizza-times-newsletters/1983%20The%20Pizza%20Times%203-1/page/n3/mode/2up?q=sunnyvale</ref>
