**_Kapolei, HI (700 Haumea St.)**_ is a franchise _Chuck E. Cheese_ that opened in October 2018 and is still open. Due to long construction, this location is the last to open with the CEC 2015 Remodel Program (2015 Remodel) and the last to feature [COL]({{< ref "wiki/Circles of Light.md" >}}) with an animatronic. It is also the only COL with an animatronic to feature a dance floor.

## History ##
Kapolei began construction around 2015/2016 and was a learning experience for the franchisee. The location finished in 2018 and later opened the same year. This ended up being an interesting location, containing the [sky tubes]({{< ref "wiki/Skytubes.md" >}}) (a bigger Chuck E’s Clubhouse variant) and Avenger-era costumes. As of 2024, Kapolei remains like this.

## Costumes ##
more coming soon…

## Stage ##
Kapolei has a interesting stage, having a [Circles of Light]({{< ref "wiki/Circles of Light.md" >}}) Stage with a 2017 Dance Floor and a 16M Chuck E bot. Unfortunately, The animatronic is in poor condition, judging off a performance in 2022. Also, it has been leaned forward ever since opening in 2018.
