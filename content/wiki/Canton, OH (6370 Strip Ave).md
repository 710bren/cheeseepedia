<b><i>Canton, OH (6370 Strip Ave), Store #740</b></i> is a Chuck E. Cheese's location in Canton Ohio and is still open to this day with the CEC 2018 2.0 Remodel Program (2.0 Remodel).

<h2>History</h2>
Canton opened on July 23rd, 1998, with a Studio C (1997) (Studio C Alpha), and the 1998 remodel. Not much is known about Canton until 2010, when they received the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative (2005 Remodel) and underwent an expansion. The store would receive the CEC 2018 2.0 Remodel Program (2.0 Remodel) on April 29, 2024, removing the stage on the same day, which is how the store currently stands as of today.
<h2>Stages </h2>
The store would end up removing its [Interactive Console]({{< ref "wiki/Interactive Console.md" >}}) in 2013, Blue Screen, and disabling their curtains in 2015, as most Studio Cs have. The stage would be removed on April 29, 2024, when the store received the 2.0 Remodel.
