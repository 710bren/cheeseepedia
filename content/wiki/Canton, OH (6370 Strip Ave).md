##  History ## 
Canton opened on July 23rd, 1998 with a [\2](\1), and the 1998 remodel. Not much is known about Canton until 2010, when they recieved the 2005 Remodel and underwent an expansion. The store would end up removing its [[Interactive Console]] in 2013, Blue Screen, and disabling their curtains in 2015, as most Studio Cs have. Today, they still have the 2005 remodel with Chuck wearing his Rockstar outfit.
