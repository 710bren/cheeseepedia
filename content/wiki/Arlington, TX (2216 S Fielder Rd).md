<b><i>Arlington, TX (2216 S Fielder Rd), Store #416,</b> was</i> a <i>Pizza Time Theatre</i> that opened in October 1980 with a [Balcony Stage]({{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage.md" >}}), and closed on March 17, 2024, after nearly 44 years in operation.<ref></ref>

The location was the first Pizza Time Theatre to be opened in the state of Texas and would regularly be visited by CEC for various media and training purposes.

This location was commonly confused with the [3200 Justiss Dr.]({{< ref "wiki/Arlington, TX (3200 Justiss Dr).md" >}}) location, which opened as a <i>Showbiz Pizza Place.</i>
<h2>Stages </h2>
Arlington Fielder would be the first location to open with the [Balcony Stage]({{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage.md" >}}), with Madam Oink as the guest character<i>.</i> When the stage was installed, there was a hole in the back of the stage that led to the play area. It was unknown if the right-side entrance was there at the time or if there was another entrance in another room. This location's final guest character was in 1984 when Helen Henny would become a permanent addition to the Pizza Time Players.  

On February 1, 1987, Arlington Fielder would also become the first location to utilize [Chuck E.'s House]({{< ref "wiki/Chuck E's House.md" >}}). It was worth noting that the stage and showroom area was not against a perimeter wall yet as the play area was still behind the stage.
Around 1988 they got the [1988 Remodel]({{< ref "wiki/SPT 1988 Remodel Program.md" >}}) and dropped the Pizza Time Theatre name for Showbiz Pizza along with [Irving]({{< ref "wiki/Irving, TX (3903 W Airport Fwy).md" >}}), and [Chino]({{< ref "wiki/Chino, CA (5250 Philadelphia St).md" >}}).

Between 1993 and 1995, the swing-bound Helen Cyberamic received 1990s cosmetics. 

In 1997, Chuck E.'s House was replaced by a [2-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/2-Stage.md" >}}). The showroom and stage were moved to be against the back perimeter wall of the location, eliminating the play area.

In 2019, the location received parts from the [Irving, TX]({{< ref "wiki/Irving, TX (3903 W Airport Fwy).md" >}}) [1-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/1-Stage.md" >}}) after that location received its 2.0 remodel. 

Around November 5th of 2022, Arlington's 2-Stage was observed to be mostly empty. On November 6, 2022, the [Video Wall]({{< ref "wiki/Video Wall.md" >}}) and Chuck E. Live Stage (Dance Floor) (Dance Floor) were completely installed.
<h2>=Cabaret/Lounge Acts</h2>=
Arlington Fielder opened with [Dolli Dimples]({{< ref "wiki/Dolli Dimples (Cabaret).md" >}}) in the cabaret and had prototype Beagles animatronics in the lounge. The Beagles were replaced with The King at some point. It was unknown when each act would be removed or replaced.

<h2>History</h2>
This location <i>was</i> the 16th Pizza Time Theatre location to ever open, and the very first in the state of Texas. On opening day, this store had a large ceremony; Nolan Bushnell made a surprise appearance, according to a local journalist who interviewed him at the event. 

The store would remodel for the first time around 1986 as part of unifying Pizza Time Theatre and Showbiz Pizza Place; shortly after, in 1991, the location would receive one of the first new art packages that would eventually inspire a future to remodel in the 1990s which leaned in heavily with this parody theming. The next remodel occurred sometime in 2003 during the initial testing phases of the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative ('Cool Chuck' Major Remodel Initiative).

In November 2016, the Phase 4 awnings were removed.

On July 20, 2018, the location was visited by CEC fans during Chuck E. Con 2018, alongside [Grapevine, TX]({{< ref "wiki/Grapevine, TX (2755 E Grapevine Mills Circle).md" >}}).

In October 2022, the Arlington store began its 2.0 Remodel, this remodel in particular would be the first done in-house by CEC themselves. this bought unforeseen consequences, as this remodel looked incomplete after it was finished.  

Fielder would permanently close on March 17, 2024, after nearly 44 years in operation due to problems with increased lease after the center the store was in went under new ownership.  

<h2>= Play Area </h2>=
Behind the [Balcony Stage]({{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage.md" >}}) sat a play area upon opening. this play area eventually would evolve into a Chuck E. Cheese Play-N-Place (Chuck E's Play-N-Place) featuring a mini rollercoaster, Dolli's Descent, and various other things. Children were able to access the play area through a hole on the back of the stage. 

With the installation of Chuck E.'s House, elements would be removed from the play area and an entrance would open up on the right side of the stage. 

In the early to mid 1990's they would open up the other side of the play area making an entrance on the left side as well. 

In 1997 when they installed the 2-Stage they would remove the play area and push back the stage into the former space along with creating more dining space.

<h2>=Failed Concepts</h2>=
This store was also the first to test the live Chuck E. Cheese performance concept; using a somewhat articulated Chuck E. Cheese head specially made for the performance where its mouth would be articulated<ref name=':0'>https://showbizpizza.com/info/documents/spt/spt_87entertainment.pdf</ref>.

The location would start to test 'Surprises' around 1987. Surprises were animatronics placed around the store that would have a sensor that would activate it, making it tell a joke, pun, or compliment.  At the same time, a showroom remodel was being considered that would completely overhaul the general effect it would give. The concept for this was called 'Chuck E.'s Town Square', where the showroom would be transformed into a miniature town square with buildings.<ref name=':0' /> It was unknown if the concept made it to Arlington or not due to how undocumented it was. 

<h2>=Chuck E. Cheese University</h2>=
A little to known fact about this location was that this store houses a back room known as 'Chuck E. Cheese's University‚Äù where managers and technicians from around the country would be trained. For technicians, a full [Rock-Afire Explosion]({{< ref "wiki/Classic Stage.md" >}}) would be placed back there to train them, while higher-ups watched through a one-way mirror. Later on, this room would house the [Awesome Adventure Machine stage]({{< ref "wiki/Awesome Adventure Machine.md" >}}) to be finalized and programmed before making its way to the [Dallas Montfort, TX]({{< ref "wiki/Dallas, TX (13125 Montfort Dr).md" >}}) location.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mqJMsr_PLU</ref> As of now this room was still within the location, however, it was used for storage.
