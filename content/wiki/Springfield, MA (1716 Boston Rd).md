**_1716 Boston Rd**_ was a Showbiz Pizza Place that opened on March 22, 1983 with a Rock-Afire Explosion, and closed on June 18, 2020.

## History ##
Springfield opened its doors on March 22nd, 1983 as the first and only ShowBiz Pizza Place in New England in the Haymarket Square with a Rock-afire Explosion show. It was originally a franchise-owned store. Although very little documentation exists back in the ShowBiz days, it can be determined that Pineville was one of several locations to receive an Uncle Klunk show package (and a Santa Claus retrofit package as well) sometime after opening. It had a typical SPP layout (Except for the Show being on the right side wall) seen in many other stores across the United States and would eventually receive the 1988 remodel years after it would open. Like many ShowBiz locations in the late 1980s, Springfield received the Showbiz Pizza Campground upgrade. On July 14th, 1990, Springfield was bought out by Corporate. 

In the year 1991, Concept Unification was in full swing and Springfield would be one of a majority of SPP locations to undergo it that year and became the only location in New England with the 3-Stage setup. Sometime in 1993-1995, Springfield remodeled to either the  or . 

By 2002, Springfield replaced all the Latex Masks with plastic ones. Pizzacam was removed in around 2005-2007. In 2006, a small fire broke out; damaging the show; Building & Moon were disconnected the same year. In 2006-2007, Chuck's Tuxedo & Derby was replaced with the Cool Chuck outfit. Then they received the  in Summer 2009. In around 2011-2012, Chuck's Cool Chuck outfit was replaced with the Avenger outfit. Chuck's cap was removed in September 2013 with the MMB Sign being removed not long after On July 1, 2017, a small Chuck E. Cheese Fan Convention called Crittercon 2017 was held at the location with fans figuring out what was wrong with the show; with the store's Cyberstar glitching time to time, Building & Moon were also found behind the buildings after being decommissioned for around 11 years. In October 2017, Springfield would convert their show into a Cyberamic 3-Stage; replacing their bots with the Cyberamics from the [Burlington, MA (10 Wall St)]({{< ref "wiki/Burlington, MA (10 Wall St).md" >}}) location which remained relatively unchanged except for the removal of Munch's cap. In June 2020, Springfield permanently closed their doors due to leasing issues & the COVID-19 pandemic. 

As of October 2022, the location is still vacant with the frames of the letters & logo, & awnings up on the building intact.
