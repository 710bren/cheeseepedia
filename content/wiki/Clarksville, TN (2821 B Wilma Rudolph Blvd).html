<p>Originally when the store opened, they had a Studio C Prototype, this was a rare stage, being installed in only 5 locations, with Clarksville being the last to be installed. They were the first Prototype to get the 2.0 Remodel in August / September 2019, being replaced with the Dance Floor. As of October 2022, they still have this remodel, as well as the Studio C Prototype going extinct at Midland, Texas on October 18, 2022.</p>
