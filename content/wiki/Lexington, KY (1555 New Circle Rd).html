<h2> History </h2>
Lexington opened on December 1st, 1983 as the second Showbiz Pizza Place in Kentucky, after <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Paducah, KY (5141 Hinkleville Rd)" >}}">Paducah</a> which opened the year prior, in the Woodhill Circle Plaza. Lexington received the SPP 1988 Remodel|1988 Remodel in around 1998-1989. They then underwent Concept Unification in 1991. Lexington then received another remodel in the Mid 1990's which involved the removal of elements from the 1988 remodel such as The Blue & White Awnings, checkers around the store, & neon lights. Then in 2006 or 2007, they received the CEC 2005 Remodel which involved the store being expanded, therefore gutting the current showroom, replacing the 3-Stage with a Studio C Beta 16m, & turning the current Showroom into a gameroom. Then they would receive the 2.0 Remodel in 2019, replacing the Studio C Beta 16m with a Dance Floor. As of October 2022, they are the second last former Showbiz in Kentucky, as the Owensboro location closed in 1998. They were a franchise store, and were acquired by corporate on September 16th, 1996, along with many other locations and closing Rochester (Penfield), NY.
<h2> Stages </h2>

Cheese characters. They would have the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Concept Unification Stage" >}}">3-Stage</a> until either 2006 or 2007, when they would replace it with a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Studio C Beta" >}}">Studio C Beta</a>, 16m, this was the first and only <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Studio C Beta" >}}">Studio C Beta</a> in Kentucky, as Louisville has a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Studio C Alpha" >}}">Studio C Alpha</a>, and Bowling Green had a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Studio C Cappa" >}}">Studio C Cappa</a>.
