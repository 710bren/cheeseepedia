<p><b><i>Chuck E. Cheese's Astrology</b></i> is an automated [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrological_sign astrological sign] generator and forecaster created by <i>Destron, Inc.</i> in 1982.</p>
<p>The cabinet has no game functions, and simply has the user put in their quarter, press the desired buttons, and will be printed a generated card specific to their request. The card will include their [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrological_sign astrological sign], a random selection of 'forecasted events' taking place on the date the player chose, and a lucky number.</p>
<p>The cabinet is a licensed variation of the standard <i>Destron Astrology</i> cabinet, which also debuted in 1982. The cabinet is a continuation of the <i>Destron Bio-Rhythm</i> line, which came in four cabinet types. The Astrology cabinet most resembles the smallest <i>Model 600</i> line, now with a large vertical sign, and a movement of the coin slot to the front of the cabinet.</p>
<p><h2> Usage </h2></p>
<p>The user inserts their quarter to turn on the display. They will be prompted by instructions on the cabinet to type in their birth date, a desired forecast date, and press the start button to begin printing. Due to limited information, and evidence in the <i>Destron Bio-Rhythm</i> manual<sup>[1]</sup>, there may possibly be a speaker on the cabinet that would read these instructions or other info from a <i>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_synthesis speech synthesized voice].</i></p>
<p>The card would then be printed with auto-generated text. Presumably the text would be the same if the same birth date and desired date were entered again. The printed info would be:</p>

<p><h2> Technical </h2></p>
<p>The CPU type is unknown, and no ROM dumps are available. Other Destron games of the era used a 6802-based CPU<sup>[2]</sup>, and this game may also use the same but remarked, judging from the 40-pin package and apparent manufacture by AMI.</p>
