<b><i>1931 Pembina Hwy</b></i> was a <i>Chuck E. Cheese</i> that opened on April 30th, 1990, as a corporate-owned location with Chuck E.'s House or the Rocker Stage and closed in July 2001 (day unknown) with the 1-Stage.

It was the only location in Manitoba and the 9th Canadian location to open.

It was also the only location in Canada to receive the 1-Stage.
<h2>History</h2>
Winnipeg opened its doors on April 30th, 1990, as the ninth Chuck E. Cheese store in Canada. Unfortunately, there is hardly any documentation of Winnipeg. In 1991, In the early-mid 90's, Winnipeg underwent a minor remodel removing some decor for newer decor and replacing the [[Chuck E.'s House|Rocker Stage]] for the [1-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/1-Stage.html" >}}). Around 1997 or 1998, the location received the [[SPT 1992 Remodel Program|SPT 1992 Remodel]] removing older 90's decor, adding newer decor, another exterior change, and SkyTubes. Around July 2001, the location closed for unknown reasons, most likely due to lease or parking issues. After closure, the store became multiple businesses with the red awning still up until 2008-2009 when it was removed, and the entire building was re-painted. Currently, as of 2024, the location is still standing although taken up by a spa.
<h2>Stages</h2>
Originally, Winnipeg featured Chuck E.'s House, as all other Chuck E. Cheese locations had in 1987-1990. Unfortunately, there are a couple photos to exist of Winnipeg with the Chuck E.'s House, and 1-Stage as there is only one photo of the location's exterior in general. In July 2001, the location closed and removed their 1-Stage.
