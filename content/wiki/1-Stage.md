The **1-Stage** is a stage format found at [[Chuck E. Cheese's]] locations which either opened with the stage or replaced a previous stage from 1992 to 1998,  and one in 2011. It was the last Munch's Make Believe Band stage created, and the last Cyberamic stage created, as the next stage to be created was the Studio C Alpha. As of September 2022, there are 30 1-Stages, 28 in the United States, and 2 in Chile.
