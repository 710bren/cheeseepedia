##Transcript##
The segment is narrated by two unknown newscasters, alongside Aaron Fecther speaking during the interview.<blockquote>**Willie Rabbit:** I'm Willie Rabbit, a friend of The Wizard at the Mystery Funhouse. He wants me to invite you out to a scare-rifical, fantastical visit while you're in Orlando.


**Newscaster 1:** Aaron has the idea to use animated characters for advertising purposes and Willie is the first to do so, and with no limit to his vocabulary.


**Aaron Fechter:** He's got a computer inside. The computer selects from various numbers, uh, messages, which he is capable of producing- and so it's pretty random, you never know what he's gonna say next.

**Newscaster 2:** -very...why?


**Aaron Fechter:** I'd be inclined to say why not, but a customer asked me to build it for him and that's why.


**Newscaster 2:** Well, what is he gonna do? Is he gonna put it in his living room? Uh, stare at it before he goes to bed at night? What's it for?


**Aaron Fechter:** No, I'm afraid if he put it in his living room, the landlord would probably raise the rent quite a bit. He's putting it out in front of a carnival ride that he owns, and the carnival ride is gonna make a million dollars more a year because it's standing out front, attracting the customers.
