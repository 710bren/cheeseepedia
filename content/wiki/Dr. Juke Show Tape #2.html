The <b><i>Dr. Juke Show Tape #2</i></b> is the second test tape of {{< wiki-link "Dr. Juke" >}}, which is in the standard Creative Engineering reel format rather than Dr. Juke's proposed Laserdisc format. It is unknown exactly when this tape was produced, or why its format was not on Laserdisc.

<h2>Show List</h2>
The tape is known to contain the Satisfaction Medley, Goin' Crazy / My Love, and Music Goes Round & Round. While 4 showtapes from 1982 contain these songs, it is likely this is a copy of {{< wiki-link "Show Select Tape 2" >}} due to the nature and labeling of the tapes.<sup>(1)</sup>
