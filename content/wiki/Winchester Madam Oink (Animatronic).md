<b><i>Winchester Madam Oink</b></i> was a Guest Star animatronic featured at the first Pizza Time Theatre in [San Jose, CA (370 S Winchester Blvd)]({{< ref "wiki/San Jose, CA (370 S Winchester Blvd).md" >}}).

<h2>History</h2>
Winchester Madam Oink was installed in February of 1978, replacing [Winchester Helen Henny]({{< ref "wiki/Winchester Helen Henny (Animatronic).md" >}}). She would later be replaced in October of 1978 with [Winchester Foxy Colleen]({{< ref "wiki/Winchester Foxy Colleen (Animatronic).md" >}}). Sometime after this she was sent back to [Sunnyvale]({{< ref "wiki/Pizza Time Theatre Sunnyvale, CA Corporate Office.md" >}}). Her current whereabouts are unknown, but she was most likely destroyed along with most of the other portrait bots during the move to the [Showbiz Pizza Time Corporate Office]({{< ref "wiki/Showbiz Pizza Time Corporate Office.md" >}}) in 1984. 

<h2> Design</h2>
Madam Oink had short white hair, hazel eyes, a green dress, a white necklace, a gold ascot, an emerald ring, a feather boa in her right hand, and a metallic grey microphone in her left hand similar to Winchester Chuck E. Cheese V2 (Animatronic) (V2 Winchester Chuck).
