The <b><i>Lounge</b></i> <b><i>Helen Henny {{< wiki-link "Cyberamics" >}}</b></i> were a set of around 2 animatronic figures created by {{< wiki-link "Pizza Time Theatre" >}} from 1979 to 1980 for Lounge acts. They were designed after the PTT guest star, {{< wiki-link "Helen Henny" >}}.
There are very little known to be produced as she was immediately replaced by {{< wiki-link "The King  King Kat (Lounge)" >}}, though later Helen Henny cosmetics were created for the {{< wiki-link "Guest Star  Helen Henny (Cyberamic)" >}}, which became the only ones after the merger.
<h2>History</h2>
The bot would first debut at the {{< wiki-link "Huntington Beach, CA (15511 Edwards St)" >}} in Late 1979 with the Cabaret Helen Showtape. The bot was stationed at Huntington's former lounge area.

The bot was quickly replaced by {{< wiki-link "The King  King Kat (Lounge)" >}}, with the last Helen being removed during Huntington Beachâ€™s 1988 Remodel.
