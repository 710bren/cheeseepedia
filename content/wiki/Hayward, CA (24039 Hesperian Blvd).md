Starting in 2015 the new tech at the time wasn’t really caring for the stage, things like head spinning, Air leaks, teeth coming off, and the Bot isn’t aired up were happening. In 2017 the bot was air down and his teeth were missing for like 3 months until it was air up again. From December 2017-Early to 2018 the bot's mouth keep opening and shutting randomly while his back is stuck leaning and his mask is slowly falling apart. But things went back to good condition when the tech got fired and Doug become the stage tech in late 2018 and fix and got Chuck E back to working order. Sadly in 2022 Doug have sadly passed away and the new tech Ben is now working on Chuck E and got him a new mask that doesn’t have teeth for some reason but teeth were added a month later. As of September 2022, the bot is working decent but the lights are sadly burned out.
