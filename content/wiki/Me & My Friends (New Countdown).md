## Live Show Trivia: ##

* The brand new Countdown is 7 minutes long. At the start it showcases 'Me & My Friends' at the top telling people what live will begin once the countdown is over.
* At the end of every minute Matt Daniel says the amount of time left until the live show. Despite the fact if you just looked at the screen you could obviously tell. 
* The countdown track are instrumentals for various CEC songs released in the past few years. The songs in order are Lend a Helping Hands Instrumental, and Because We're Friends Instrumental.

* At the two minute mark it fades into the original countdown giving instructions on how to do the live show. 
* The Ticket Splash is replaced with purple curtains closing with the 2017 2.0 logo using the stock cheering sound effect until the live show ends. 

* This was originally released with Show 1 2021 on Studio C/Weigi but wasn't able to be played. 
* Eventually with the Show 1 2021 (Covid Promo Update) for again only Studio C and Weigi 
* With Show 1 2021 (Ryan's FanFest World Promo) update Me & My Friends was able to be played on 3stage and Cyberamic stages.
