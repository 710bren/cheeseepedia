<p><b><i>Northridge, CA (8425 Reseda Blvd, Store #451)</b></i> was a Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre that opened in September 1981<sup>[1]</sup> with a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Cyberamics Balcony Stage" >}}">Cyberamics Balcony Stage</a>, which is still open to this day.</p>
<p>The location is officially deemed the Munch's Make Believe Band Residency (Now called CEC Legacy Location) with plans for it to be a permanent home for its <a href="{{< ref "wiki/2-Stage" >}}">2-Stage</a> and 'all legacy Chuck E. Cheese nostalgia'<sup>[2]</sup>. The Store was originally going to be the permanent home of CEC animatronics, but in March 2024, CEC went back on this<sup>[3]</sup>.</p>
<p><h2> Stages </h2></p>
<p>Originally when the store opened, they had a Balcony Stage, as all other Pizza Time Theatres had. They would have the Balcony Stage for several years, until the late 80's or early 90's, when they would convert to Chuck E.'s House Facade, they would have it for a very short time, when in 1993, they would convert to a 2-Stage. Only major cosmetical changes to happen prior to 2011 was the replacement of the tuxedo with Cool Chuck sometime during the 2000s. In 2011, the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Lancaster, CA (44650 Valley Central Way)" >}}">Lancaster, CA (44650 Valley Central Way)</a> location would relocate and with that, all of their animatronics would be sent to Northridge to replace their original 1981 PTT Cyberamics. They now have 1990s Cyberamics which are much sturdier than the originals and having cosmetics in much better shape. Despite Northridge getting the 2.0 remodel the stage's TV would be replaced by August 15th, 2023 and was also kept to become the 'permanent home of the Chuck E. Cheese animatronic gang'. Chuck E's outfit would be replaced with the Rockstar shirt on October 26th the same year, followed by the stage receiving lift curtains from <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Huntington Beach, CA (15511 Edwards St)" >}}">the Huntington Beach location</a> on November 5th.</p>

<p><h2> History </h2></p>
<p><h3> 1981-1992 </h3></p>
<p>Opened in September 1981 as a Pizza Time Theatre with a Balcony Stage. As lounge and cabaret acts they would receive The King and Dolli Dimples, opening with Harmony Howlette. In the late 80s they would receive the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/SPT 1988 Remodel Program" >}}">SPT 1988 Remodel Program</a> removing the remains of Pizza Time Theatre.</p>
<p><h3> 1993-2023 </h3></p>
<p>In 1993 Northridge would receive the SPT 1992/1993 Remodel Program|SPT 1992 Remodel Program which would renovate the restaurant bringing in the shelves, balcony, records and more! Around this time they would also receive the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/2-Stage" >}}">2-Stage</a>. The store would remain untouched with only minor changes such as receiving carpet from the CEC 2010 Update Program and installed a Salad Bar poster from the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/CEC 2005 Remodel Program" >}}">CEC 2005 Remodel Program</a>.</p>
<p><h3> 2.0 Remodel </h3></p>
<p>On July 25, 2023 Northridge would start its <a href="{{< ref "wiki/CEC 2018 20 Remodel Program" >}}">2.0 Remodel</a>. It was originally intended to become a standard 2.0 according to blueprints. But last minute plans changed, and it became the first Munch's Make Believe Band Residency|Chuck E. Cheese Legacy Location. Although originally planned to keep more of the 90s artwork, due to lack of discussion between CEC Entertainment, LLC & The Supervisor of the remodel these plans were dropped and all old artwork was either destroyed or sent to <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Showbiz Pizza Time Distribution Center (Topeka, KS)" >}}">Showbiz Pizza Time Distribution Center (Topeka, KS)</a>. Currently all that remains from the 1993 remodel are the 2-Stage and the Shelves, which had the Chuck E. Cheese statues removed a few months prior.</p>
