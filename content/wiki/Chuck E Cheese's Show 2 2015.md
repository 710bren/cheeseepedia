## Trivia: ##

* This show started a new era for CEC content. The animatronic programmed skits were now one-off skits with no acts.
* This is the final time Baking with Betty would ever be used in a showtape. 
* Because We're Friends is originally from September 2014 and Rockin' Robot is originally from Summer 2014.
* A brand new countdown was created to replace the Michael Hill one. It features a girl doing some sort of activity every minute. From Getting out of bed, Sports, Cooking, Teaching then Celebration.
