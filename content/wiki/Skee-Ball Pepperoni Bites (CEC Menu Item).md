Add 8 bite-sized rolls stuffed with pepperoni and melty cheese to your meal. Served with your choice of ranch or marinara dipping sauce.|menugroup=Appetizer}}The **_Skee-Ball Pepperoni Bites**_ were a limited time appetizer at Chuck E. Cheese locations from 2018 through 2019.<ref>https://m.facebook.com/ChuckECheese/videos/rock-pizza-roll/2189010168002795/</ref>

The item is a long strip of pepperonis and cheese wrapped in a 15 inch roll of dough, served with marinara sauce or ranch. The item is meant to look like the neck of a guitar, with its box completing the look.
## Rereleases## 
The initial release started on October 1, 2018, with the item being discontinued on December 30th.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20190105214629/https://www.chuckecheese.com/menu</ref> Two months later the item would relaunch and continue presumably into the summer<ref>https://www.fastfoodpost.com/chuck-e-cheeses-introduces-rock-and-pizza-roll/</ref> A third launch would happen on October 1, 2019, continuing somewhere into late November.

The third launch would see an updated description on the website:<blockquote>The Rock & Pizza Roll is back for an encore! This pizza roll is over-sized (at 15 inches long!), which makes it the perfect appetizer or snack for anyone in the family. Our fresh-made dough is stuffed with cheese and pepperoni, baked fresh and served with the sauce of your choice (marinara or ranch). This fun, one-of-a-kind item is available starting on October 1st, while supplies last.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20191019041535/https://www.chuckecheese.com/menu</ref></blockquote>
## Guitar Jingle## 
The side of the box denotes a small interactable feature that teaches kids how to play a simple tune on a guitar, with a representation of a guitar neck on the other side. Presumably kids would try this on the box while eating, and when they get home play it on a real guitar. The box states:<blockquote>The number in the dot shows which numbered fret to go to.

(A fret is the space between two lines on a guitar neck.)

The line the dot is on shows which string to hold down and pluck.</blockquote>No pictures currently show which numbers are on the box lines, though the tune is seven notes, with the first three on the D note, and the latter on the C note. Presumably this is the 'Where a Kid Can Be A Kid' liet motif, promoting kids to learn how to play the tune.
