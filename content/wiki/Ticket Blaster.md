The **Ticket Blaster** is an attraction found at Chuck E. Cheese's locations. It is only able to be used when there is a reserved birthday party. The point of the Ticket Blaster is to grab as many tickets as you can within 30 seconds, as well as possibly getting other things like a 'Magic Ticket'. The Ticket Blaster is still in use to this day, despite CEC getting rid of paper tickets, though some locations have them empty, others have tickets and the other prizes in them.

## How To Play ##
The Ticket Blaster is only available with a reserved birthday party at any CEC location. When getting into the Ticket Blaster, you have to wear goggles since the tickets are paper and are flying everywhere and could hurt your face. When you are inside, Chuck E. will say something, and then the tickets start flying around, you have 30 seconds to 1 minute to get as many tickets as you can, and when the timer stops, the tickets stop flying around, and you are let out of the Ticket Blaster.
