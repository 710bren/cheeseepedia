<p><h2>History</h2></p>
<p>Columbus (Columbus Square) opened its doors in 1982 with a Balcony Stage show and was originally a franchised store. Like many other Pizza Time Theatre locations, it had a typical PTT layout seen in many other stores across the United States.</p>
<p>At some point in 1988-1989, Columbus (Columbus Square) would receive the 1988 Remodel removing some PTT decor for newer decor, added Blue and White awnings above the salad bar, added checkers, and converted the Balcony Stage to the C-Stage, otherwise known as Chuck E.'s House Facade.</p>
<p>In December 1991, the location was purchased by Marc Glassman and removed all PTT decor and mentions of Chuck E. Cheese, retrofitted the characters, and repainted some of the PTT playground set. The location ended up closing in 1996 ad became multiple businesses. Currently, as of May 2023, the location is now a mattress and a furniture store.</p>
