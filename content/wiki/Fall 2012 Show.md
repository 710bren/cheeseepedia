* All the live shows for Fall 2012 still use Duncan's voice. 
* A Duncan cut of this show exists but is currently lost media and is unknown if corp has a copy of the Duncan cut of Fall 2012.
* A Character in this show is introduced called 'Chaze' Its character is to take common phrases and take them literally. He is never seen or mentioned prior to this show or after this show. 

* This show mentions lots of references to Duncans early show work for CEC such as having Segment 4 have the band reading through a script of September 1994 Segment 1 Dialogue. As the show is ending they make more jokes about various other show lines of the past with Pasqually saying 'Remember Destination Imagination' and Jasper responds 'Now that is a joke'. 
* This is the final show to use the Band Stage set up for the puppets. This would also be the last time new footage was shot with them as the next time puppets were used with April 2013 they received new puppets to match the rockstar design.
