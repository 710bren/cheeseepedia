##History##
Huntington Beach opened on October 6th, 1979 as the fifth CEC/PTT to open. Unfortunately, there is hardly any information when it was a PTT, but we do know they had a Portrait Stage. This location also had the rare Cabaret Helen Henny. Huntington Beach had the stage and the store unchanged until the late 80's when they received the 1988 remodel. They removed the Portrait Stage for the C-Stage and added the early 90's decor, and the Cabaret Helen Henny was removed. They would remain like this until their second remodel in the mid-late 90's. They then removed the C-Stage for the 2-Stage and removed the early 90's decor and added new decor and SkyTubes. They would remain like this until the 2005 remodel between 2006-2007 when they removed the Showroom Walls, Portrait Seating, and relocating the 2-Stage. Currently, as of January 2023, they still have the 2-Stage and 2005 remodel and is safe from the 2.0 remodel.
##Stages##
Huntington Beach opened with the Balcony Stage in October 1981. Unfortunately, there are some photos but hardly any videos to exist of Huntington Beach.
