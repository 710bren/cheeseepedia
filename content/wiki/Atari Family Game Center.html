The <b><i>Atari Family Game Center</b></i> (Also known as the <b><i>Atari Leisure Time Game Center</b></i><sup>(1)</sup> and <b><i>Atari Game Center</b></i><sup>(2)</sup>), was a set of mall arcades predating the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Pizza Time Theatre" >}}">Pizza Time Theatre</a> concept from April of 1974 to Spring of 1975.<sup>(3)</sup>
The arcades would exclusively house Atari arcade games, built with custom cabinets to fit the interior design of the locations. The locations would also offer pinball machines and a variety of board games to play. Patrons could also purchase their own Atari arcades from the store for individual use or for small private organizations.<ref name=':0'>https:<i>www.ataricompendium.com/archives/interviews/jerry_donaldson/interview_jerry_donaldson.html</ref><sup>(4)</sup>
