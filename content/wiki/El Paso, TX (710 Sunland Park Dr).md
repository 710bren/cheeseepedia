## History ##
Sunland Park opened on February 21, 1994, as the third location in El Paso, and the first and only to get a 1-Stage. They would get the second-to-last Mini Unit variant of the stage. This type of 1-Stage would only be installed    .

The store would have many similarities between one of the other Mini Unit stores in Durham, NC, having an almost identical interior and exterior when they both first opened.

### 1990s ###
Sunland Park would open up with the  games package sometime in the early 90s. In the late 90s, the store would get updated signage and awnings on the exterior, and receive the  games package.

### 2000s ###
The store would receive minimal changes throughout the decade, and would only see a few changes, such as Chuck E. getting his derby hat changed out for a Cool Chuck cap in the early 2000s, while retaining the tuxedo, and the store would also receive the  games package in the early 2000s.

### 2010s ###
Sunland Park would start seeing lots of changes starting in the early 2010s, when in 2011, the store expanded, receiving the 2010 update to the [CEC 2005 Remodel Program]({{< ref "wiki/CEC 2005 Remodel Program.md" >}}), relocating the 1-Stage to the left-adjacent wall to where the stage used to sit in the corner, changing the store's layout, and receiving more games. They would also change their Cool Chuck cap to an Avenger cap, still keeping the tuxedo, until shortly after they would get the full Avenger outfit, removing the cap in 2013.

### 2020s/Present Day ###
The store would also see some changes in the 2020s to present day, such as removing the Skytubes due to COVID-19.

Sunland Park would remodel and get the [CEC 2018 2.0 Remodel Program]({{< ref "wiki/CEC 2018 20 Remodel Program.md" >}}) in April 2024, where they would remove their 1-Stage for a Chuck E. Live Stage (Dance Floor) and Video Wall, which is how the store still remains to this day.
