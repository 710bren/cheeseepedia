Gulliver's Kingdom has a retrofitted Rock-afire Explosion show renamed to 'Hard Luck Bears' located in the The Liliput Land Theatre, the character positioning is the same to the original Rock-afire Explosion set-up except the characters themselves feature different clothing and all have replacement bear masks.


The stage itself features the usual 3-stage design however with a large rectangular platform in front and 2 water fountians embedded within, the characters Antioch and Choo Choo are not on the main stage and are instead located on the rectangular stage in front, Looney Bird also used to be located under this stage but was moved to Billy Bob's stage with the shows restoration.

## History ##
The show was installed in 1995 and ran off the original Greybox control system created by Creative Engineering Inc, the show also came with an original showtape; produced by Gulliver's and programmed by Creative Engineering Inc; sometime within the 2000's this was changed out to a new control system where Gulliver's staff would program the new showtapes by themselves. The show in this state stopped being shown publically in 2016

### Restoration ###
On 27 February 2022 Instagram user 'xan_rock_afire_fan' announced that he would be restoring all 3 of Gulliver's Hard Luck Bears shows. The restoration included a full mechanical restoration, a switch to the 'BlueBox' control system, Looney Bird being relocated to the Rock-afire standard position and the shows lights being switched over to LED lights, with only the spotlights staying as the original halogen lights.

The show room got a repaint and artwork of the characters designed by Instagram user 'rockafire_guy' painted on the back walls.


The show as of now plays original Rock-afire Explosion showtapes as well as fan made showtapes and runs regularly with every open day of the park.
