Amherst, NY was a Chuck E Cheese store located at 4994 Harlem Road.  

##  History ## 
Amherst opened up in 1994, near Niagara Falls. This was the second Chuck E Cheese location to open after Showbiz Pizza converted to Chuck E Cheese a few years before. 

They opened with the 1-Stage, which has all five characters in front of a city backdrop. Amherst opened with Phase 2, which they kept up until 2012. In 2012, they received the 2012 update to the 2003 Cool Chuck Reconfiguration. 

This store sadly closed on June 25, 2020, due to the bankruptcy and also due to the fights that were happening in the location in 2018. As of today, the location has become a wine shop.
