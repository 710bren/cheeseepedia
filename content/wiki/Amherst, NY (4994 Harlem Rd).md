<b><i>Amherst, NY(4994 Harlem Rd)</b></i> was a <i>Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza/Chuck E. Cheese's</i> that opened during the summer of 1993 and closed on July 2nd, 2020.

<h2> History </h2>
Amherst opened up in 1993, near Niagara Falls. This was the 6th/7th Chuck E. Cheese's to open in New York and the first one to open during the 90s. 

They opened with the 1-Stage, which has all five characters in front of a city backdrop. Amherst opened with the 90s remodel, which they kept up until 2012. In 2012, they received the 2012 update to the 2003 Cool Chuck Reconfiguration. They also received new Rockstar signage in 2013.  

This store sadly closed on June 25, 2020, due to the bankruptcy and also due to the fights that were happening in the location in 2018. As of today, the location has become a wine shop.
