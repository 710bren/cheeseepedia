## History ##
Penfield opened on March 17, 1982 as Pizza Time Theatre with a Balcony Stage. It first had the 1981 remodel, which included Cabaret rooms, the Fantasy Forest, and of course the stage itself. In 1989/1990, the store received the 1988 remodel, which involved uniting some of the rooms and all the counters, replaced all the PTT decor with new decor, and removed the Balcony Stage for Chuck E.'s House Facade. they remained like this until September 16, 1996, when they would close possibly due to a disagreement. As of July 2023, the store is now Advance Auto Parts.
