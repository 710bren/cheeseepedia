**_Magic Stage Christmas Tape**_ was a unique showtape created for the [[Magic Stage Prototype]] in November of 1985.

The show and stage would debut at an unknown Texas store. The characters were rebranded from the Rock-afire Explosion to a band simply called 'Magic'. Character names and Rock-afire shows were still used for the showtape however. 

[\2](\1), [\2](\1), and [\2](\1) would be absent from the show due to them being taken off stage, though most likely their show signals were still being sent due to the re-use of older programming, as seen in other similar instances to removed characters.<ref>https://youtu.be/x9438Sw6fjo</ref>
