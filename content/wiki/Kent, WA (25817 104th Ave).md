Unfortunately, information on Kent in general is scarce, despite still being open. Between 2008 and 2010, Kent received the 2005 update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative, which involved removing all 90s decor for new decor, tearing down showroom walls and balcony seating, adding purple walls, and changed the exterior. Around the mid-late 2010s, the [Skytubes]({{< ref "wiki/Skytubes.md" >}}) were thrown out. In July 2024 The location Started its 2.0 remodel, removing the stage.
