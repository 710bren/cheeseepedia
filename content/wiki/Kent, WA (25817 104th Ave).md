## History ##
Kent opened in 1998 (month and day unknown) with a Studio C (1997) (Studio C Alpha) stage and the [Phase 2]({{< ref "wiki/Phase 2 (1997).md" >}}) remodel. Unfortunately, information on Kent in general is scarce, despite still being open. Between 2008 and 2010, Kent received the 2005 update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative, which involved removing all 90s decor for new decor, tearing down showroom walls in balcony seating, adding purple walls, and changed the exterior. Around the mid-late 2010s, the [Skytubes]({{< ref "wiki/Skytubes.md" >}}) were thrown out. As of July 2023, Kent remains like this.
