##  History ## 
Kent opened in 1998 (month and day unknown) with a [\2](\1) stage and the [\2](\1) remodel. Unfortunately, information on Kent in general is scarce, despite still being open. Between 2008 and 2010, Kent received the 2005 update to the [[2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative]], which involved removing all 90s decor for new decor, tearing down showroom walls in balcony seating, adding purple walls, and changed the exterior. Around the mid-late 2010s, the [[Skytubes]] were thrown out. As of July 2023, Kent remains like this.
