<b><i>801 Worcester St, Store #479</b></i> was a <i>Chuck E. Cheese's</i> that opened on November 17, 1992 & closed on May 5, 2020, with a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/2-Stage" >}}">2-Stage</a>.

<h2> History </h2>
Natick opened on November 17, 1992, with a 2-Stage. The 2-Stage had a unique construction, being built to have a hallway behind it. This hallway gave access to restrooms and storage areas at the back of the store while also having special shape mirrors in various colors. Natick's first remodel occurred in the Mid 1990's with the removal of elements from the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/SPT 1988 Remodel Program" >}}">SPT 1988 Remodel Program</a> such as the Blue & White Awnings, checkers around the store, & neon lights. In the Early 2000's Chuck's outfit would be replaced with the Cool Chuck outfit. In around 2006, Natick remodeled again to the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/CEC 2005 Remodel Program" >}}">2005 Remodel</a> which involved the removal of Showroom Walls, Balcony Seating, & adding purple walls. Natick received the Avenger outfit sometime in 2009, before the cap was removed in 2013. Sometime in 2014, a second foyer was added due to the landlord, Cognex Corporation, taking over the former restaurant space next door for offices. The <a href="{{< ref "wiki/CEC 2005 Remodel Program" >}}">2005 Remodel</a> red hanging lamps over the tables as well as the SkyTubes were kept until June 2016, being removed during the PlayPass installation. Munch's hat was removed in late 2019. In May 2020, Natick permanently closed. 

<h2>=Post Closure</h2>=
During the closure, all animatronic mechs were thrown into the Cognex trash compactor. The stage with various props was still seen up until a few weeks later. Shortly after, the location became warehouse space for Cognex Corporation, repainting the building, gutting the interior, and building racks for storage.
