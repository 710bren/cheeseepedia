## History ##
Knoxville opened on August 23rd, 1982 as the second Showbiz Pizza Place in Tennessee, after Madison which opened 2 months prior which was June 15th and as a Franchised Store. Knoxville originally featured the Rock-Afire Explosion, as all other Showbiz locations did. they would have it for a few years, until around 1991, when they would receive the 1988 remodel, receiving Concept Unification, where the Rock-Afire Explosion characters were changed to the Chuck E. Cheese characters, and removing all SPP decor for newer decor. Knoxville would remain this way until it's closure in Summer 1997. It is unknown what happened to the show after the store's closure. Sometime after closure, the store was demolished for Texas Roadhouse. As of April 2023, Texas Roadhouse still sits on the site where the location once stood. However, A  (Now owned by CEC Corporate) would open down the road as freestanding building with a 1-Stage. That location got 2.0 in April/May 2022.
