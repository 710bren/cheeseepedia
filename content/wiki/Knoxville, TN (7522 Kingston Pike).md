<b><i>7522 Kingston Pike</b></i> was the second <i>Showbiz Pizza Place</i>/<i>Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza</i> that opened in Tennessee on August 23rd, 1982 with a [Rock-afire Explosion]({{< ref "wiki/Classic Stage.md" >}}) and closed in Summer 1997 with the [3-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/Concept Unification Stage.md" >}}).

This location relocated to the [8225 Kintgston Pike]({{< ref "wiki/Knoxville, TN (8225 Kingston Pike).md" >}}) location.

<h2> Stages </h2>
Originally, Knoxville featured a Rock-Afire Explosion, as all other Showbiz locations did, it was the second to be installed in the state of Tennessee. In 1991, the location received [Concept Unification]({{< ref "wiki/Concept Unification.md" >}}) and was removed in Summer 1997 due to the closure of the location. It is unknown what happened to the show after the store's closure.

<h2> History </h2>
Knoxville opened on August 23rd, 1982 as the second Showbiz Pizza Place in Tennessee, opening two months after the [Madison]({{< ref "wiki/Madison, TN (2070 Gallatin Pike).md" >}}) location. Knoxville originally featured the Rock-Afire Explosion, as all other Showbiz locations did. 

In 1991 the location would remodel for the first time under the newly formed 1986 SPT Remodel Program. The location would remain this way until it's closure in Summer 1997.
