The **_Kooser Chuck E. Cheese**_ bot is an animatronic used at the second Pizza Time Theatre location at [San Jose, CA (1371 Kooser Rd)]({{< ref "wiki/San Jose, CA (1371 Kooser Rd).md" >}}). It would continue to be used up until the [Kooser PTT Show]({{< ref "wiki/Kooser PTT Show.md" >}}) was replaced by the Showboat Stage in 1980.

## History ##

### Kooser Store ###
The bot debuted at the opening of the Kooser store in December of 1978 where it would continue to perform up until the switch to the more standardized Showboat/Balcony Stage was made in 1980. Following this renovation, Kooser Chuck would be replaced by a Chuck E Cheese (Cyberamic) (Cyberamic) version.

### Corporate Move ###
Following its removal from Kooser in 1980, the bot would later find a home at the [Sunnyvale, CA corporate office]({{< ref "wiki/Pizza Time Theatre Sunnyvale, CA Corporate Office.md" >}}), where it can be seen in photos of the Costume Department as early as 1981. At this point, it would be sporting Christmas attire as opposed to its store-original derby and vest, and would also be missing its teeth.

## Appearance ##

In many ways, Kooser Chuck is not too dissimilar in appearance to its elder Winchester counterparts. A natural progression of prior iterations, it sports a similar triangular head shape to the Winchester Chuck E. Cheese V1 (Animatronic) (first Winchester bot) as well as the realistic eyes and large ears of the Winchester Chuck E. Cheese V2 (Animatronic) (second).The bot's clothing consists of a paisley vest, black tie, and 3-buttoned yellow undershirt that are nigh identical to Winchester V2. Other carried-over aspects are the microphone and cigar.

However, there are also several details that distinguish this bot from its predecessors. Unlike the second Winchester bot, Kooser Chuck's hands are entirely felt. Additionally, its right arm remains stretched outward at all times as opposed to being bent at the elbow or tucked away. The 'PIZZA TIME THEATRE' text printed on the rim of its derby is also something that had not been seen before, and is an aspect of the character that would become tradition among later iterations going forward.

## Movements ##
Thanks to the moving video footage of the animatronics present in 'Real People' segment covering the Kooser store, it can easily be determined what movements the bot was capable of. The visible movements are as follows:

* Mouth
* Head Turn
* Head Tilt
* Eye Turn
* Eyelids
* Right Arm Raise
