the 1978 Madam Oink Nameplate was only used at the first Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre on [370 South Winchester Boulevard]({{< ref "wiki/San Jose, CA (370 S Winchester Blvd).md" >}}) located in the Town & Country Shopping Center in San Jose California; placed under [Winchester Madam Oink]({{< ref "wiki/Winchester Madam Oink (Animatronic).md" >}}) was in use to identify the animatronic.

<h2> Production </h2>
Although not much is known about the production outside of speculation by the community, we can assume it was made shortly before or after the production of the Winchester Madam Oink at the Fantasy Forest Manufacturing Company and was most likely shipped alongside the animatronic if that is the case. On the other hand, it is entirely possible the nameplate was made in-house by Pizza Time Theatre Incorporated aswell.

<h2> Usage </h2>
The only usage of the nameplate was at the Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre on 370 South Winchester Boulevard, placed on the guest star portrait from February 1978 to November 1978, where it was most likely shipped to Sunnyvale alongside Winchester Madam Oink or kept in storage at the store itself. 

<h2> Design </h2>
Like all other Winchester nameplates, Madam Oinks nameplate used a brown, rounded wooden base with the white text 'MADAM OINK' surrounded by a thin yellow border as all other nameplates from the location, which also had the text 'Â© PIZZA TIME THEATRE INC, 1978' below. It is unknown if the copyright text was placed later on or was shipped with.
