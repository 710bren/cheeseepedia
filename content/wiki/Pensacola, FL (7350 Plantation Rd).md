## History ##
This store opened as a Showbiz Pizza Place on December 6, 1981.

In August of 1991, Pensacola received their first remodel, with white walls, checkers, a relocated ordering counter, and showroom walls with -then-new for Showbiz- windows.

Pensacola received their second remodel in 1995, obtaining record posters, rainbow lights, and a large sky crawl system.

In 2012 for unknown reasons the store did a minor remodel. The wall next to the salad bar and the speaker walls next to the stage were painted purple; the showroom shelves and lamps were also removed.

On July 31, 2017, the following posters were randomly removed as per request of DM: 1993 Saloon poster, 1991 Jasper, Helen, Chuck, and Pasqually postcards, various magazines, 1994 baseball bat and 3D baseball, 1994 hockey stick and hockey puck, Toddler Zone firetruck poster, and 1994 small green and red stars. These posters were distributed amongst cast members and some were given to a fan.

This store's 2.0 remodel process started the week of July 12, 2018 and was completed in mid August 2018.
