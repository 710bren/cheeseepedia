<p>The <b><i>Chuck E. Cheese 32m Animatronic</b></i> is an animatronic figure created by Garner Holt Productions Inc. for Chuck E. Cheese's locations, manufactured from 1997-2001. The <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Chuck E Cheese 16m (Animatronic)" >}}">Chuck E. Cheese 16m (Animatronic)</a> was created in 2002 to replace this animatronic due to it's cost.</p>
<p><h2> History</h2></p>
<p>After the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Awesome Adventure Machine" >}}">Awesome Adventure Machine</a> concept failed, the one animatronic show concept was still being considered. Soon enough, Showbiz reached out to a few manufactures one being Creative Presentations. But being unable to help Showbiz, they suggested that they contacted Garner Holt.<sup>[1]</sup></p>
<p>In 1997, Garner Holt built their first batch of 32 function Chuck E. Cheese animatronics, the first appearance being on October 3rd, 1997 for an invite only event at the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Showbiz Pizza Time Corporate Office" >}}">Showbiz Pizza Time Corporate Office</a> and a hand-full of locations. In February 1998 Chuck E. was unveiled at the 1998 CEC General Managers Las Vegas Convention (Event)|General Managers Convention. 160 of these Chuck E. Animatronics were placed in locations by the year 2000 and later ended production in 2001, only finishing one batch that year.</p>

<p><h2>Trivia </h2></p><ul><li>The prototype animatronic had wrists that turned 180 degrees. This was considered unnatural so they changed it to just 90 degrees.</li><li>Figures made in 1997 had wire in their hands so that they were able to have their fingers bent to hold things.</li><li>The Garner Holt website in the late 1990s to early 2000s erroneously stated that the animatronic had 33 movements.</li></ul>
