<h2> Notes </h2>

* Features the [1982 Articulated Chuck Walkaround]({{< ref "wiki/1982 Articulated Chuck Walkaround.html" >}}).
* Unlike [[Smile America - 30s 1 (Commercial)|Smile America - 'Alice' (Commercial)]], this features unique shots not seen in the 60 second version, namely the Chuck E. Cheese Roller sequence and a mirrored shot of Mr. Munch interacting with a kid.
