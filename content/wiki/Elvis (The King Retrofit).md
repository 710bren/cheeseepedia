##History##
Elvis was first installed in 1988 during an expansion to Jungle Jim's International Market. He was originally from the [Cincinnati, OH (11400 Princeton Pike)]({{< ref "wiki/Cincinnati, OH (11400 Princeton Pike).md" >}}) Pizza Time Theater and was bought in an auction. During his original location he was located in the frozen foods section which is now today checkout lanes. His stage originally was originally a backdrop of gold streamers and on the floor was moonshine jugs and rocks from the Rock-afire Explosion.Elvis looked identical to how he looked during his PTT Days. In 1998 the stage, his outfit and guitar were updated. The backdrop was changed from gold streams to a printed image of a beach with palm trees covering it along with that a Elvis neon sign was installed. The Moonshine jugs were moved to the cigar section of the store and the rocks were destroyed. Elvis's outfit was changed from the original silver and white outfit to a blue and gold outfit. His guitar was then repainted from the original red design to a gold paint with black trim.

In 2001 due to the expansion of the checkout Elvis was relocated to right in front of checkout which today is where the 'EXOTIC MEATS' are located. Everything from the 1998 update was kept with the only noticeable change between the original 88' location and the 01' position is a white strip that was located above the backdrop.<ref>http://www.showbizpizza.com/photos/misc/elvisshow/index.html</ref> This position lasted from 2001 until 2004. Then in 2005 it was relocated to where it currently is located in the candy section of the store. Since 2005 he's gone through 2 major changes to his condition. From 2010-2011 Elvis was taken out of Jungle Jim's and was being converted from cylinder based to become servo based. Comparing footage from 2010 <ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enqyOObhn88</ref>and 2011<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uH8DNcyk3vA</ref> once returning he was in far worse shape although by 2012 <ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n77pX0Kwmf0</ref>he was back to normal condition. From 2011 - early 2019 Elvis stated in the same condition with only the foot tap breaking sometime in 2017. 

During the summer of 2019 Elvis was shipped off to be repaired by Life Formations. A sign was installed during that time frame that stated 'Elvis has left the building; But the king will return'. On August 2nd 2019 'The King' returned which fixed the speed of him most importantly, the movements that were working on August 2nd 2019 were Mouth, Eye Left, Eye Right, Blink, Head Left, Head Right, Head Up, Strum Hand and Right Leg. A total of 8 movements out of 13 movements. Pre repairs Elvis had a total of 5-6 movements those being Mouth, Eye Left, Blink, Strum Hand, Fret Hand, Foot Tap (until 2017). As of May 2022 Elvis is currently broken and does not work but it still on display.

One last thing to note is that Elvis had intros before his 5 songs. Those intros minus the one before [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hound_Dog_(song) Hound Dog] is lost. Those were removed during the 2010-2011 updates. It's unknown as to when they were added. Another thing Jungle Jim's does to Elvis is during the holiday season is dresses him up as Santa and has him sing holiday Elvis songs. It is currently unknown what all the songs he sang were and also when they began dressing him up.
