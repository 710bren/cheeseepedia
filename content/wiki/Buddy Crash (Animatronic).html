<h2> History </h2>

<h2> Design </h2>
In his design for Americana Amusement Park, he wore a top hat, collar, black bowtie, and striped vest. At Morey's Piers he wore a straw hat, red bandana, and overalls. He plays the drums with the '4 Seasoned Bears' logo on the front.

<h2> Movements </h2>
Due to lack of footage or photos of internals, movements can only be inferred. All that is known is that he along with the rest of the bots in the show had very limited movement.
