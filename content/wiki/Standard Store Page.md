<b><i>Address goes here in bold italics</b></i> was a <i>Chuck E. Cheese's</i> that opened in (date) with a (which animatronic stage), which closed in (date if it did close).

Discuss here any quick and important notable information. Such as if it was a Showbiz previously, if it had any big changes, or notable events and news.
<h2>Stages</h2>
History of the animatronic stages it hosted. Such as 'It started as a Rock-afire, then in 91 became a 3-stage, then in 1994 it was converted to a Studio C, where it is still working today', but in more detail. Deterioration and show quality should be noted as well, especially for it currently. 'Currently the stage is in disrepair, with Chuck's mouth lever broken and curtains not working'.
<h2>History</h2>
notable history, but any big events like a car crashing into the building or someone dying or like something actually cool happening to one of these stores make a separate header above this.
<h2>=Sub header for an event</h2>=
Events should be segmentable using subheaders since there's possibly a lot of history. Feel free to segment stuff like key moments, phases, stage changes, ect.

<h2> Arcade Machines </h2>
A list of all arcade machines at the store. If its an official CEC machine, be sure to link to its page.

* Pac-Man
* Frogger
* [Chuck E. Cheese's Circus]({{< ref "wiki/Chuck E Cheese's Circus.md" >}})

<h2>Videos</h2>
These are any videos found of the location on YouTube in modern day. Just link directly to the video with its presumed filming date. This is also good for making direct citations to claims made in the history section, and if anything notable in the video shows something about its history, it should be described.

Just like the videos, a gallery of all the pictures in and out of the store. Just caption them by their date, down to the day if you can. There's no limit to this gallery's size.

<h2> Animatronics </h2>
The current whereabouts of the store's animatronics, and their serial numbers if applicable. You should put up here where this text goes if the animatronics are still in their store, or if the store has closed and they're now out in the world. Some people may skip all the history sections above and just check this section, so a quick summary on all of their whereabouts is helpful, especially if they transferred to another store.

(If your store uses Cyberamics or an animatronic that doesn't use serial numbers, just replace with 'Manufacturing Date')
