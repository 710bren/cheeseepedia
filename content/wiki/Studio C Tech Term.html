The <b><i>Studio C Technician Terminal,</b></i> or 'Studio C Tech Term', is a handheld device used for configuring and testing the [Studio C]({{< ref "wiki/Studio C.md" >}}) programmable movements and lights.

The device can check and switch which programming banks, called DTUs (Digital Terminal Units), allow manual diagnostics for single movements on the show<ref>https:<i>youtu.be/6ih4nsIWX5o</ref>, and 'blind' movements, which will prevent them from receiving data to turn on. This allows movements that break during a performance to not cause further damage until maintenance can occur at a later time.<ref>https:</i>www.showbizpizza.com/info/documents/cec/cec_studiocmanual.pdf</ref>
