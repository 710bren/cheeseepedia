The **Balcony Stage** was a stage format found at Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre locations that opened with the stage or replaced a Portrait Stage from 1980-1986. It debuted at the [San Jose, California, (1371 Kooser Rd)]({{< ref "wiki/San Jose, CA (1371 Kooser Rd).md" >}}) location in May of 1980, and went extinct in 2001 at the [Lake Forest, California]({{< ref "wiki/Lake Forest, CA (24416 Muirlands Blvd).md" >}}) location. The C-Stage was a 'retrofit' of the Balcony Stage, changing it from a balcony to a house.
