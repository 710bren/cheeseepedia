<h2> History </h2>

<h2>= Pre-Production </h2>=
In Early 1980, after the opening of [Sparks, NV (530 Greenbrae Dr)]({{< ref "wiki/Sparks, NV (530 Greenbrae Dr).md" >}}) & [Citrus Heights, CA (7614 Greenback Lane)]({{< ref "wiki/Citrus Heights, CA (7614 Greenback Lane).md" >}}), Pizza Time Theatre wanted to make a more standardized Portrait Stage.

Arlington's Blacony was also more like the later Balcony Stages with the characters being lower down & their being a Cheese-Crawl. 

Most locations still opened with a Balcony Stage until December 1980. The Balcony stage was installed at all PTT locations afterwards. 

<h2>== Later Balcony Stages </h2>==
The 'Irish Stew' & '[Around The World]({{< ref "wiki/Around the World (PTT Theme).md" >}})' Showtapes would have special theme for Balcony Stages. The Balcony Stage would have variants for most other Showtapes following. A Balcony Stage would be installed at the Amusement Park, 'Kids World' in the early to mid 80's, The stage wasn't segmented, meaning their were no barriers between the bots, & there was a strange backdrop behind the characters.

All locations forward would open with a Rocker Stage & several existing locations also switched to Rocker Stages. In 1988, Showbiz corporate would set up Chuck E.'s House Facades to replace the fronts & backdrops of Balcony Stage, to make them look like a house.

The last Balcony Stage would be located at [Edmonton, Alberta, Canada (9271 34th Ave)]({{< ref "wiki/Edmonton, Alberta, Canada (9271 34th Ave).md" >}}) which was replaced in 1993 for a [2-Stage]({{< ref "wiki/2-Stage.md" >}}).
