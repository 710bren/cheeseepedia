## History ##
Before Takoma Park opened, a shop called “The Store” stood in the predominantly Latino shopping center named Hampshire Langley. It closed sometime in 2012. Chuck E. Cheese’s immediately began work on the property and began to refurbish it, making a new exterior. They opened with a Circles of Light stage. It is not know when they are to receive the 2.0 update.
